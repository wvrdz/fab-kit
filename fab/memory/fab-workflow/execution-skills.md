# Execution Skills

**Domain**: fab-workflow

## Overview

Execution behavior (apply, review, hydrate) is accessed via `/fab-continue`, which dispatches to the appropriate behavior based on the active stage. The standalone skills `/fab-apply` and `/fab-review` no longer exist as separate commands — their behavior is consolidated into `/fab-continue`. `/fab-archive` exists as a standalone housekeeping skill (not a pipeline stage) for moving completed changes to the archive. All execution behaviors in `/fab-continue` inherit the optional `[change-name]` argument, which is passed to the preflight script for transient change resolution without modifying `fab/current`.

**Status mutations**: All `.status.yaml` progress transitions, checklist updates, and confidence writes use `_stageman.sh` CLI commands (`transition`, `set-state`, `set-checklist`, `set-confidence`) via the Bash tool, rather than direct file editing. This centralizes validation and ensures atomic writes with `last_updated` refresh.

**Pipeline invocation**: Both `/fab-ff` and `/fab-fff` use the same execution behavior internally as part of their full-pipeline runs. `/fab-ff` presents interactive rework options on review failure; `/fab-fff` bails immediately. Both accept an optional `[change-name]` argument.

## Requirements

### Apply Behavior (via `/fab-continue`)

`/fab-continue` dispatches to apply behavior when the active stage is `tasks` or `apply`. It executes tasks from `tasks.md` in dependency order, running tests after each completed task.

#### Task Execution

1. Parse `tasks.md` for unchecked items (`- [ ]`)
2. Execute tasks in dependency order
3. Respect parallel markers `[P]`
4. After completing each task, run relevant tests (e.g., the test file for the module just modified). Fix failures before moving on
5. Mark each task `- [x]` immediately upon completion (not batched at the end)
6. Update `.status.yaml` progress after each task

#### Resumability

Apply behavior is inherently resumable. If the agent is interrupted mid-run, re-invoking `/fab-continue` picks up from the first unchecked item. The markdown checklist *is* the progress state — no separate tracking needed.

#### Context

Loads: config, constitution, `specs/index.md`, `tasks.md`, `spec.md`, relevant source code (files referenced in tasks).

### Review Behavior (via `/fab-continue`)

`/fab-continue` dispatches to review behavior after apply completes. It validates implementation against specs and checklists. On pass, it advances to hydrate readiness. On failure, it presents rework options.

#### Validation Checks

The agent SHALL perform all of these checks:
1. All tasks in `tasks.md` marked `[x]`
2. All checklist items in `checklist.md` verified and checked off — the agent re-reads each `CHK-*` item, inspects relevant code/tests, and marks `[x]` or reports failure
3. Run tests affected by the change (scoped to modules touched, not the full suite)
4. Features match spec requirements (spot-check key scenarios from `spec.md`)
5. No memory drift detected (implementation doesn't contradict memory files)

#### On Pass

All checks succeed → stage advances to review done.

#### On Failure

The agent presents options and the user chooses where to loop back:

- **Fix code** → `/fab-continue` — Implementation bug. The agent identifies which tasks need rework, unchecks them in `tasks.md` (marks `- [ ]` with a `<!-- rework: reason -->` comment), and re-runs `/fab-continue`
- **Revise tasks** → edit `tasks.md`, then `/fab-continue` — Missing or wrong tasks. New tasks get next sequential ID. Completed unaffected tasks stay `[x]`
- **Revise spec** → `/fab-continue spec` — Requirements were wrong or incomplete. Resets to spec stage, updates `spec.md`. Tasks subsequently regenerated

The general rule: **artifacts at and after the re-entry point are regenerated or updated; artifacts before it are preserved.**

#### Context

Loads: config, constitution, `specs/index.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `spec.md`, target memory file(s) from `fab/memory/`, relevant source code (files touched by the change).

### Hydrate Behavior (via `/fab-continue`)

`/fab-continue` dispatches to hydrate behavior after review passes. It completes the pipeline: validates review passed and hydrates learnings into memory files. The change folder remains in `fab/changes/` after hydrate — archiving is a separate step via `/fab-archive`.

#### Behavior

1. **Final validation** — review MUST have passed (all tasks `[x]`, all checklist items `[x]` including N/A items)
2. **Concurrent change check** — scan `fab/changes/` for other active changes whose specs reference the same memory files. If found, warn: "Change {name} also modifies {file}. After this hydrate, that change's spec was written against a now-stale base. Re-review with `/fab-continue` after switching to it."
3. **Hydrate into `fab/memory/`**:
   - From `spec.md` → integrate new/changed requirements and scenarios into the Requirements section. Remove requirements the spec explicitly deprecates. Extract durable design decisions into Design Decisions section
   - Compare against existing memory file to determine what's new vs changed vs removed — no explicit delta markers needed
   - Minimize edits to unchanged sections to prevent drift
4. **Update status** to `hydrate: done` in `.status.yaml`

#### Recovery

Hydration modifies memory files in-place. If the merge goes wrong, the only recovery is `git checkout` on the affected memory files. Commit (or at least review the diff) before pushing after hydrate.

#### Context

Loads: config, constitution, `specs/index.md`, `spec.md`, `brief.md`, target memory file(s) from `fab/memory/`, `fab/memory/index.md` and relevant domain indexes.

### `/fab-archive` (Standalone Skill)

`/fab-archive` is a standalone housekeeping command — not a pipeline stage. It supports two modes: **archive** (default) moves completed changes to the archive; **restore** moves archived changes back to active.

#### Archive Mode

##### Precondition

Requires `hydrate: done` in `.status.yaml`. If hydrate is not done, it stops with: "Hydrate has not completed. Run /fab-continue to hydrate memory first."

##### Behavior

1. **Move change folder** — `fab/changes/{name}/` → `fab/changes/archive/{name}/`. Create `archive/` if needed. No rename.
2. **Update archive index** — prepend entry to `fab/changes/archive/index.md` (create with backfill if missing). Format: `- **{folder-name}** — {1-2 sentence description}`. Most-recent-first.
3. **Mark backlog items done** — exact-ID check (always), then keyword scan with interactive confirmation
4. **Clear pointer** — delete `fab/current` only if the archived change is the active one

##### Fail-Safe Order of Operations

Steps 1–4 execute in this order for safety. Folder move first (recoverable if interrupted — re-run detects folder already in archive and completes remaining steps). Index after folder is in place. Backlog marking after index. Pointer last.

#### Restore Mode (`/fab-archive restore <change-name> [--switch]`)

Restores an archived change back to `fab/changes/`. Inverse of the archive operation. Preserves all artifacts and `.status.yaml` without modification — no status reset, no artifact regeneration.

##### Precondition

`<change-name>` is required. Resolved via case-insensitive substring matching against folder names in `fab/changes/archive/`. Supports exact/single/ambiguous/no-match flows (same pattern as `/fab-switch`).

##### Behavior

1. **Move change folder** — `fab/changes/archive/{name}/` → `fab/changes/{name}/`. No rename. All artifacts preserved.
2. **Remove archive index entry** — remove the entry for `{name}` from `fab/changes/archive/index.md`. Preserve empty index file.
3. **Update pointer** (conditional) — if `--switch` flag provided, write `{name}` to `fab/current`. Otherwise no-op.

Steps execute 1→3 for safety. If interrupted, re-run detects folder already in `fab/changes/` and completes remaining steps (index cleanup, optional pointer update).

#### Key Properties

- Does NOT modify `.status.yaml` progress (may update `last_updated`)
- Accepts optional `[change-name]` argument for targeting a specific change (archive mode)
- Conditional pointer clearing in archive mode — only clears `fab/current` when the archived change is the active one
- Restore mode requires explicit `<change-name>` — no "restore most recent" convenience
- Restore mode optionally activates via `--switch` flag

## Design Decisions

### Checklist Tests Implementation Fidelity, Not Spec Quality
**Decision**: The quality checklist validates "does the code match the spec?" rather than "is the spec well-written?"
**Why**: Fab has explicit spec review during the spec stage (via `/fab-clarify`). A separate requirement-quality checklist is redundant. The checklist focuses on what matters at review time: implementation correctness.
**Rejected**: SpecKit-style requirement-quality checklist — duplicates work already done during planning stages.
*Source*: doc/fab-spec/TEMPLATES.md

### Review Failure Offers Multiple Re-Entry Points
**Decision**: On review failure, the agent presents three options (fix code, revise tasks, revise spec) and the user chooses where to loop back.
**Why**: Not all review failures are implementation bugs. Some require revisiting upstream artifacts. Giving the user explicit choice prevents the agent from guessing wrong about where the problem originated.
**Rejected**: Always looping back to apply — misses cases where the spec was wrong.
*Source*: doc/fab-spec/SKILLS.md

### Hydrate Semantically, Not by Delta Markers
**Decision**: The agent compares `spec.md` against existing memory files to determine what's new, changed, or removed. No ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED markers in the spec.
**Why**: The spec reads as a straightforward requirements document. Delta markers would clutter the spec and couple it to the hydration mechanism.
**Rejected**: Explicit delta markers — clutters specs, requires discipline to maintain, fragile to editing.
*Source*: doc/fab-spec/TEMPLATES.md

### Concurrent Change Warning on Hydrate
**Decision**: Before hydrating, scan for other active changes that reference the same memory files and warn the user.
**Why**: Hydration updates the memory files, which may invalidate assumptions in other active changes. The warning prompts re-review rather than allowing silent drift.
**Rejected**: Blocking hydrate if concurrent changes exist — too restrictive, especially for independent changes that happen to touch the same domain.
*Source*: doc/fab-spec/SKILLS.md

### Hydrate is a Pipeline Stage, Archive is Not
**Decision**: Memory hydration (`hydrate`) is a tracked pipeline stage; folder housekeeping (`/fab-archive`) is a standalone skill.
**Why**: Memory hydration is the logical completion of the agent's work — it closes the feedback loop from implementation back to memory files. Folder housekeeping is a user-triggered cleanup action with no bearing on artifact quality.
**Rejected**: Both as pipeline stages — would add a 7th stage for marginal benefit. Neither as pipeline stages — would lose the memory hydration automation.

### Restore as Subcommand, Not Separate Skill
**Decision**: Archive restore is a subcommand of `/fab-archive` (`/fab-archive restore <name>`), not a separate `/fab-restore` skill.
**Why**: Archive and restore are paired inverse operations. Grouping them under the same skill maintains conceptual cohesion and avoids skill proliferation. Users naturally look for restore under the archive command.
**Rejected**: Separate `/fab-restore` skill — adds a new top-level command for a narrow, complementary operation.
*Introduced by*: 260214-v7k3-archive-restore-mode

### fab-archive Clears Pointer Conditionally
**Decision**: `/fab-archive` only clears `fab/current` when the archived change is the active one.
**Why**: If archiving a non-active change (via change-name argument), clearing the pointer would disrupt the user's active work context.
**Rejected**: Always clear — would lose active change context when archiving a different change. Never clear — would leave stale pointer after archiving the active change.
*Introduced by*: 260213-jc0u-split-archive-hydrate

### Execution Stage Reset Preserves Task Checkboxes
**Decision**: `/fab-continue apply` re-runs apply behavior starting from the first unchecked task. It does NOT uncheck all tasks.
**Why**: Task checkboxes reflect actual implementation progress. Silently unchecking them would discard valid work. Review rework (Option 1: "Fix code") handles targeted unchecking with `<!-- rework: reason -->` annotations.
**Rejected**: Resetting all checkboxes on apply reset — too destructive, discards completed work.
*Introduced by*: 260212-a4bd-unify-fab-continue

### Review Active Triggers Forward Progression
**Decision**: When the active stage is `review`, `/fab-continue` runs the review behavior (advancing toward hydrate), not re-review. Re-review is available via `/fab-continue review` reset.
**Why**: The normal flow always advances. `review: active` means "review needs to run"; `review: done` means "review passed, hydrate is next." This avoids ambiguity about whether the command should redo or advance.
**Rejected**: Having review active trigger re-review — conflicts with the forward-progression model.
