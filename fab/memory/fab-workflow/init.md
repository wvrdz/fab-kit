# Init

**Domain**: fab-workflow

## Overview

`/fab-init` is the structural bootstrap skill that creates the `fab/` directory layout. It also provides subcommands for managing `config.yaml` and `constitution.md`, and for validating their structure. It does not handle memory hydration — that responsibility belongs to `/fab-hydrate`.

## Requirements

### Structural Bootstrap Only

`/fab-init` performs only Phase 1 (structural bootstrap). It does not accept `[sources...]` arguments and contains no source hydration logic.

- Creates `fab/config.yaml` (project configuration)
- Creates `fab/constitution.md` (project principles)
- Creates `fab/memory/index.md` (memory index skeleton)
- Creates `fab/specs/index.md` (specifications index skeleton — pre-implementation, human-curated)
- Creates `fab/changes/` directory
- Creates skill symlinks via `_fab-scaffold.sh` glob pattern
- Creates `.gitignore` entries
- Safe to re-run (idempotent — skips existing files)

### Subcommands

`/fab-init` accepts three subcommands: `config [section]`, `constitution`, and `validate`. These provide ongoing management of initialization artifacts without requiring separate commands.

### Unrecognized Arguments Rejected

When arguments other than recognized subcommands are passed, init outputs a redirect message: "Did you mean /fab-hydrate? /fab-init no longer accepts source arguments." No hydration occurs.

### Output

First-run output lists only structural artifacts created. Next step suggests `/fab-new <description>` or `/fab-hydrate <sources>` to populate memory. The "With Sources" output section has been removed.

### Bootstrap Alternative

As an alternative to manual `cp -r`, new projects can use the one-liner bootstrap:

```
curl -sL https://github.com/wvrdz/fab-kit/releases/latest/download/kit.tar.gz | tar xz -C fab/
```

After extraction, run `fab/.kit/scripts/_fab-scaffold.sh` then `/fab-init` as usual.

## Related Commands

For post-initialization management of config and constitution files, see the [init family](init-family.md):

- `/fab-init constitution` — create or amend the constitution with semantic versioning (see [constitution governance](constitution-governance.md))
- `/fab-init config` — interactive config.yaml updates preserving comments (see [config management](config-management.md))
- `/fab-init validate` — structural validation for both files

## Delegation Pattern

`/fab-init` delegates structural setup to `fab/.kit/scripts/_fab-scaffold.sh` and adds interactive configuration on top. This means `_fab-scaffold.sh` can be run independently (e.g., in CI or after a bootstrap download) without requiring `/fab-init`.

| Responsibility | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Directories (`changes/`, `memory/`, `specs/`) | `_fab-scaffold.sh` | Non-interactive, scriptable |
| Skeleton files (`memory/index.md`, `specs/index.md`) | `_fab-scaffold.sh` | Copies from `scaffold/memory-index.md` and `scaffold/specs-index.md`; idempotent — skips if file exists |
| Skill symlinks (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex) | `_fab-scaffold.sh` | Discovers skills via glob pattern |
| `.envrc` symlink | `_fab-scaffold.sh` | Links to `fab/.kit/scaffold/envrc` |
| `.gitignore` entries | `_fab-scaffold.sh` | Appends entries from `scaffold/gitignore-entries` if not present |
| `config.yaml` | `/fab-init config` (delegated by `/fab-init`) | Single source of truth for config generation and updates |
| `constitution.md` | `/fab-init constitution` (delegated by `/fab-init`) | Single source of truth for constitution generation and amendments |

`/fab-init` invokes `_fab-scaffold.sh` as step 1f of its bootstrap sequence. Steps 1c–1e in `/fab-init` have idempotent guards so they gracefully skip artifacts already created by `_fab-scaffold.sh`.

**Bootstrap path** (without `/fab-init`): After downloading `fab/.kit/` via curl or `cp -r`, running `_fab-scaffold.sh` alone creates a complete structural scaffold. `/fab-init` is only needed to generate `config.yaml` and `constitution.md`.

## Design Decisions

### Init as Pure Structural Bootstrap
**Decision**: `/fab-init` only creates directory structure and configuration files. Source hydration is delegated to `/fab-hydrate`.
**Why**: Clean separation of concerns — bootstrap runs once per project, hydration runs whenever new sources need ingesting. Using "init" for repeated hydration was confusing.
**Rejected**: Keeping hydration in init with an optional flag — muddled the interface and made init's help text complex.

### Redirect Message for Old Interface
**Decision**: When arguments are passed to `/fab-init`, show a helpful redirect to `/fab-hydrate` instead of silently ignoring.
**Why**: Better UX — users who remember the old interface get guided to the new one.
**Rejected**: Silently ignoring arguments — confusing, user would think hydration happened.

## Deprecated Requirements

### Source Hydration (Phase 2)
**Deprecated by**: 260207-q7m3-separate-hydrate-smart-context (2026-02-07)
**Reason**: Source hydration extracted to dedicated `/fab-hydrate` skill for better separation of concerns.
**Migration**: Use `/fab-hydrate [sources...]` instead of `/fab-init [sources...]`.
