# Quality Checklist: Remove Rust Implementation

**Change**: 260312-96nf-remove-rust-implementation
**Generated**: 2026-03-12
**Spec**: `spec.md`

## Functional Completeness
- [x] CHK-001 Rust source deleted: `src/rust/` directory does not exist
- [x] CHK-002 Rust helper script deleted: `src/scripts/just/rust-target.sh` does not exist
- [x] CHK-003 Justfile Rust-free: no "rust" references (case-insensitive) in `justfile`
- [x] CHK-004 Dispatcher Go-only: `fab/.kit/bin/fab` contains no `fab-rust` references
- [x] CHK-005 Package script clean: `src/scripts/just/package-kit.sh` contains no `fab-rust` references
- [x] CHK-006 _scripts.md updated: no "rust" references (case-insensitive) in `fab/.kit/skills/_scripts.md`
- [x] CHK-007 kit-architecture.md updated: no "rust" references (case-insensitive) except in changelog
- [x] CHK-008 distribution.md updated: no "rust" references (case-insensitive) except in changelog
- [x] CHK-009 packages.md updated: no `fab-rust` in directory tree listing (only in changelog)

## Behavioral Correctness
- [x] CHK-010 Dispatcher executes fab-go when present — verified: `fab --version` returns "fab 0.35.6 (go backend)"
- [x] CHK-011 Dispatcher error message references only fab-go when no backend found — verified: "no fab backend found (expected fab-go in ...)"
- [x] CHK-012 `fab --version` shows "go backend" only, no "rust" in output — verified: "fab 0.35.6 (go backend)"
- [x] CHK-013 Backend override `FAB_BACKEND=rust` is silently ignored (falls through to fab-go) — verified: still returns "fab 0.35.6 (go backend)"

## Removal Verification
- [x] CHK-014 No fab Rust backend Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock files (under `src/rust/`) exist in the repo — **NOTE**: `src/benchmark/statusman-rust/Cargo.{toml,lock}` exist but are an independent benchmark tool, not part of the fab Rust implementation. The spec's intent covers `src/rust/fab/` Cargo files which are deleted.
- [x] CHK-015 No `fab-rust` binary referenced in any shell script — verified: no `.sh` files reference `fab-rust`
- [x] CHK-016 Deprecated "Transition Period: Dual Backends" section removed from distribution.md — verified: only appears in changelog entry describing its removal

## Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK-017 `just build-all` succeeds without Rust toolchain (Go-only) — verified: cross-compiles all Go binaries for 4 targets
- [x] CHK-018 Dispatcher with fab-go present executes correctly — verified via `fab --version`
- [x] CHK-019 Dispatcher with no backend exits 1 with correct error — verified: exit code 1 with "no fab backend found (expected fab-go in ...)"

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [x] CHK-020 `FAB_BACKEND=rust` with no fab-rust binary: falls through to fab-go without error — verified: `FAB_BACKEND=rust fab --version` returns "fab 0.35.6 (go backend)"

## Code Quality
- [x] CHK-021 Pattern consistency: edits follow existing style of surrounding code — dispatcher is clean POSIX sh, justfile follows existing recipe patterns
- [x] CHK-022 No unnecessary duplication: no leftover Rust references or dead code — no active code references Rust; only changelog entries and change archive files contain historical mentions

## Documentation Accuracy
- [x] CHK-023 Memory changelog entries added for the Rust removal in both kit-architecture.md and distribution.md — verified: line 479 in kit-architecture.md, line 222 in distribution.md
- [x] CHK-024 All documentation consistently describes Go-only architecture — verified: dispatcher, _scripts.md, memory docs, and packages.md all describe Go-only

## Cross References
- [x] CHK-025 No dangling references to removed files (rust-target.sh, src/rust/) — verified: no shell scripts reference `src/rust/` or `rust-target.sh`

## Notes

- Check items as you review: `- [x]`
- All items must pass before `/fab-continue` (hydrate)
- If an item is not applicable, mark checked and prefix with **N/A**: `- [x] CHK-008 **N/A**: {reason}`
