# /fab-switch [change-name] [--blank] [--branch <name>] [--no-branch-change]

> Read and follow the instructions in `fab/.kit/skills/_context.md` before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

Switch the active change to a different one, or deactivate all changes with `--blank`. Accepts a full or partial change name, matches it against existing change folders in `fab/changes/`, updates `fab/current` to point to the selected change, and handles git branch integration. When invoked with `--blank`, deletes `fab/current` to deactivate the current change. When invoked with no argument, lists all available changes and asks the user to pick one.

---

## Arguments

- **`<change-name>`** *(optional)* — full or partial name of the change to switch to. Supports:
  - Full folder name: `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug`
  - Partial slug match: `fix-checkout`
  - Any substring: `checkout`
- **`--blank`** *(optional)* — deactivate the current change by deleting `fab/current`. Does not perform any git operations on its own. Can be combined with `--branch` to also switch branches (e.g., `--blank --branch main`). Mutually exclusive with `<change-name>`.
- **`--branch <name>`** *(optional)* — explicit branch name to use. Creates if new, checks out if existing. Skips the interactive branch prompt. Can be combined with `--blank`.
- **`--no-branch-change`** *(optional)* — skip all branch integration (no branch creation, checkout, or prompts). Use when the branch is already correctly set up.

If no argument is provided (and `--blank` is not set), list all active changes and ask the user to pick one (see **No Argument Flow** below).

---

## Context Loading

This skill loads **minimal context plus config**:

1. `fab/config.yaml` — for `git.enabled` and `git.branch_prefix` (needed for branch integration)
2. The contents of `fab/changes/` directory (folder names)
3. The `.status.yaml` of the matched change (to display status after switching)

It does NOT load `fab/constitution.md`, `fab/docs/index.md`, or `fab/design/index.md`.

---

## Behavior

### No Argument Flow

When invoked as `/fab-switch` with no argument:

1. **Scan `fab/changes/`** for all change folders (exclude the `archive/` subdirectory)
2. **If no change folders exist**, output:

   > `No active changes found. Run /fab-new <description> to start one.`

3. **If change folders exist**, list them with their current stage:

   For each folder in `fab/changes/` (excluding `archive/`):
   - Read `fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml`
   - Extract the `stage` field
   - Display as a numbered list

   ```
   Active changes:
     1. 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug (stage: apply)
     2. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: spec)
     3. 260206-r4t7-refactor-auth (stage: spec)

   Which change? (1-3)
   ```

4. **Wait for user selection** and proceed to the Switch Flow with the selected change name

### Argument Flow

When invoked as `/fab-switch <change-name>`:

1. **Scan `fab/changes/`** for all change folders (exclude the `archive/` subdirectory)
2. **Match the argument** against the folder names:
   - **Exact match**: The argument matches a folder name exactly → use that folder
   - **Single partial match**: The argument is a substring of exactly one folder name → use that folder
   - **Multiple partial matches**: The argument matches more than one folder → list all matches and ask the user to pick (see Ambiguous Match below)
   - **No match**: The argument does not match any folder → list all available changes and inform the user (see No Match below)

### Match Rules

Matching is **case-insensitive** and checks if the argument is a **substring** of the folder name:

- `fix-checkout` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `checkout` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `260202` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `m3x1` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓

### Ambiguous Match

When the argument matches multiple change folders:

```
Multiple changes match "add":
  1. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: spec)
  2. 260206-a1b2-add-spinner (stage: spec)

Which change? (1-2)
```

Wait for user selection and proceed to the Switch Flow.

### No Match

When the argument does not match any change folder:

```
No change matches "xyz".

Active changes:
  1. 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug (stage: apply)
  2. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: spec)

Run /fab-switch <name> with a matching name, or pick from the list above (1-2).
```

Wait for user selection or let the user re-invoke with a different argument.

### Deactivation Flow

When invoked as `/fab-switch --blank`:

1. **Delete `fab/current`** — remove the file entirely (do not truncate or empty it). This is consistent with the pattern used by archive behavior in `/fab-continue`.
   - If `fab/current` does not exist, this is a no-op (already deactivated).

2. **Branch integration** (only if `--branch` is also provided):
   - If `--branch <name>` was given alongside `--blank`, handle the branch checkout using the existing `--branch` behavior (see Branch Integration section).
   - If the checkout fails (worktree conflict, branch doesn't exist, dirty tree), remain on the current branch and report the reason. The deactivation (`fab/current` deletion) still succeeds.
   - If `--branch` was NOT provided, perform no git operations. `--blank` alone only affects the fab change pointer.
   - Note: `--no-branch-change` is redundant with `--blank` (since `--blank` alone performs no git operations) but is accepted without error.

3. **Display confirmation**:

   When deactivating (no branch change):

   ```
   No active change.

   Next: /fab-new <description> or /fab-switch <change-name>
   ```

   When deactivating with branch change (`--blank --branch main`):

   ```
   No active change.
   Branch: main (checked out)

   Next: /fab-new <description> or /fab-switch <change-name>
   ```

   When deactivating but branch checkout failed:

   ```
   No active change.
   Branch: stayed on {current-branch} ({reason})

   Next: /fab-new <description> or /fab-switch <change-name>
   ```

   When already deactivated (no `fab/current` file):

   ```
   No active change (already blank).

   Next: /fab-new <description> or /fab-switch <change-name>
   ```

### Switch Flow

Once a single change is identified:

1. **Write the change name** to `fab/current`:
   - Write just the folder name (not the full path) to `fab/current`
   - This overwrites any previous content in `fab/current`

2. **Branch Integration** (see Branch Integration section below)

3. **Read the change's `.status.yaml`** to get:
   - `stage` — current stage
   - `progress` — stage progress map

4. **Display confirmation** with status summary:

   ```
   fab/current now points to 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug

   Stage:  apply (4/6)
   Branch: fix/checkout-bug (created)
   ```

   If branch integration was skipped:

   ```
   fab/current now points to 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug

   Stage:  apply (4/6)
   ```

5. **Suggest next command** based on the change's current stage:

   | Stage | Suggested next |
   |-------|---------------|
   | `brief` (active) | `Next: /fab-continue or /fab-clarify` |
   | `spec` (active) | `Next: /fab-continue or /fab-ff` |
   | `spec` (done) | `Next: /fab-continue (tasks) or /fab-ff or /fab-clarify` |
   | `tasks` (done) | `Next: /fab-continue` |
   | `apply` (done) | `Next: /fab-continue` |
   | `review` (done) | `Next: /fab-continue` |
   | `review` (failed) | `Next: /fab-continue (re-review after fixes)` |

---

## Branch Integration

**Skip this step entirely if**:
- `--no-branch-change` flag was provided, OR
- `git.enabled` is `false` in `fab/config.yaml`, OR
- The working directory is not inside a git repository

**If `--branch <name>` was provided**:
1. Use the provided name directly
2. If a git branch with that name already exists, check it out (if not already on it)
3. If it doesn't exist, create it: `git checkout -b <name>`
4. Skip the interactive prompt below

**If no `--branch` argument** (interactive flow):

Detect the current branch and offer options:

- **If on `main` or `master`**: Auto-create a branch without prompting
  - Branch name: `{branch_prefix}{change-name}` (using `git.branch_prefix` from config, which may be empty)
  - Run `git checkout -b {branch-name}`
  - This is a low-value prompt removed per SRAD scoring (high R, high A, high D — Certain grade)

- **If on a `wt/*` branch** (worktree base branch): **Present these options to the user (do NOT auto-select)**:
  - Show current branch name
  - Note: `wt/*` branches are worktree base branches — default to **Create new branch**
  - Options: **Create new branch** (default), **Adopt this branch**, **Skip**
  - If user chooses "Create new branch": create a new branch as above
  - If user chooses "Adopt": no git operation needed (already on the branch)
  - If user chooses "Skip": no branch change

- **If on a feature branch** (not main/master, not wt/*): **Present these options to the user (do NOT auto-select)**:
  - Show current branch name
  - Options: **Adopt this branch** (default), **Create new branch**, **Skip**
  - If user chooses "Adopt": no git operation needed (already on the branch)
  - If user chooses "Create new branch": create a new branch as above
  - If user chooses "Skip": no branch change

## Stage Number Mapping

Map stages to their numeric position for the `(N/6)` display:

| Stage | Number |
|-------|--------|
| `brief` | 1 |
| `spec` | 2 |
| `tasks` | 3 |
| `apply` | 4 |
| `review` | 5 |
| `archive` | 6 |

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No argument and no change folders | Output: "No active changes found. Run /fab-new \<description\> to start one." |
| No argument and changes exist | List all changes with stages, ask user to pick |
| Argument matches exactly one change | Switch to that change |
| Argument matches multiple changes | List matches with stages, ask user to pick |
| Argument matches no changes | List all available changes, inform user |
| Matched change folder missing `.status.yaml` | Switch anyway but warn: "Warning: .status.yaml not found for {name} — change may be corrupted." |
| `fab/changes/` directory does not exist | Output: "fab/changes/ not found. Run /fab-init to set up the project." |
| `fab/current` cannot be written | Report error with details |
| `fab/config.yaml` not found | Skip branch integration (git settings unknown) |
| Git branch creation fails | Report the error, continue without branch change. The switch itself still completes (fab/current is written, status is displayed). |
| `--branch` name invalid for git | Report the error, continue without branch change |
| `--blank` with `fab/current` already absent | Output: "No active change (already blank)." — no error |
| `--blank --branch` and checkout fails | Delete `fab/current` (deactivation succeeds), report git error, remain on current branch |
| `--blank` combined with `<change-name>` | These are mutually exclusive. If both provided, prefer `--blank` (deactivation intent) |

---

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Advances stage? | **No** — switch only changes the active pointer, does not modify any change's stage |
| Idempotent? | **Yes** — switching to the same change multiple times has no side effects (branch integration is skipped if already on the target branch) |
| Modifies `fab/current`? | **Yes** — writes the selected change name, or **deletes** the file when `--blank` is used |
| Modifies `.status.yaml`? | **No** — read-only access to display status |
| Modifies source code? | **No** |
| Modifies git state? | **Yes** — may create or check out a branch |
| Requires config/constitution? | **Config only** — reads `git.enabled` and `git.branch_prefix` from `fab/config.yaml` |

---

## Next Steps Reference

After `/fab-switch` completes, the Next line is contextual based on the switched-to change's current stage (see the Suggested next table above).
