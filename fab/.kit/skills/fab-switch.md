name: fab-switch
description: "Switch the active change to a different one. Lists available changes when called with no argument."
---

# /fab:switch [change-name]

> Read and follow the instructions in `fab/.kit/skills/_context.md` before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

Switch the active change to a different one. Accepts a full or partial change name, matches it against existing change folders in `fab/changes/`, and updates `fab/current` to point to the selected change. When invoked with no argument, lists all available changes and asks the user to pick one.

---

## Arguments

- **`<change-name>`** *(optional)* — full or partial name of the change to switch to. Supports:
  - Full folder name: `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug`
  - Partial slug match: `fix-checkout`
  - Any substring: `checkout`

If no argument is provided, list all active changes and ask the user to pick one (see **No Argument Flow** below).

---

## Context Loading

This skill uses **minimal context** — it does not need to load `fab/config.yaml` or `fab/constitution.md` (as noted in `_context.md`, switch is exempt from the "Always Load" requirement).

The only context needed is:
1. The contents of `fab/changes/` directory (folder names)
2. The `.status.yaml` of the matched change (to display status after switching)

---

## Behavior

### No Argument Flow

When invoked as `/fab:switch` with no argument:

1. **Scan `fab/changes/`** for all change folders (exclude the `archive/` subdirectory)
2. **If no change folders exist**, output:

   > `No active changes found. Run /fab:new <description> to start one.`

3. **If change folders exist**, list them with their current stage:

   For each folder in `fab/changes/` (excluding `archive/`):
   - Read `fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml`
   - Extract the `stage` field
   - Display as a numbered list

   ```
   Active changes:
     1. 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug (stage: apply)
     2. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: specs)
     3. 260206-r4t7-refactor-auth (stage: proposal)

   Which change? (1-3)
   ```

4. **Wait for user selection** and proceed to the Switch Flow with the selected change name

### Argument Flow

When invoked as `/fab:switch <change-name>`:

1. **Scan `fab/changes/`** for all change folders (exclude the `archive/` subdirectory)
2. **Match the argument** against the folder names:
   - **Exact match**: The argument matches a folder name exactly → use that folder
   - **Single partial match**: The argument is a substring of exactly one folder name → use that folder
   - **Multiple partial matches**: The argument matches more than one folder → list all matches and ask the user to pick (see Ambiguous Match below)
   - **No match**: The argument does not match any folder → list all available changes and inform the user (see No Match below)

### Match Rules

Matching is **case-insensitive** and checks if the argument is a **substring** of the folder name:

- `fix-checkout` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `checkout` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `260202` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓
- `m3x1` matches `260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug` ✓

### Ambiguous Match

When the argument matches multiple change folders:

```
Multiple changes match "add":
  1. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: specs)
  2. 260206-a1b2-add-spinner (stage: proposal)

Which change? (1-2)
```

Wait for user selection and proceed to the Switch Flow.

### No Match

When the argument does not match any change folder:

```
No change matches "xyz".

Active changes:
  1. 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug (stage: apply)
  2. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: specs)

Run /fab:switch <name> with a matching name, or pick from the list above (1-2).
```

Wait for user selection or let the user re-invoke with a different argument.

### Switch Flow

Once a single change is identified:

1. **Write the change name** to `fab/current`:
   - Write just the folder name (not the full path) to `fab/current`
   - This overwrites any previous content in `fab/current`

2. **Read the change's `.status.yaml`** to get:
   - `stage` — current stage
   - `branch` — associated git branch (if set)
   - `progress` — stage progress map

3. **Display confirmation** with status summary:

   ```
   fab/current now points to 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug

   Stage:  apply (5/7)
   Branch: fix/checkout-bug
   ```

   If no branch is set:

   ```
   fab/current now points to 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug

   Stage:  apply (5/7)
   Branch: (none)
   ```

4. **Suggest next command** based on the change's current stage:

   | Stage | Suggested next |
   |-------|---------------|
   | `proposal` (active) | `Next: /fab:continue or /fab:ff` |
   | `proposal` (done) | `Next: /fab:continue or /fab:ff` |
   | `specs` (done) | `Next: /fab:continue (plan) or /fab:ff or /fab:clarify` |
   | `plan` (done) | `Next: /fab:continue (tasks) or /fab:clarify` |
   | `tasks` (done) | `Next: /fab:apply` |
   | `apply` (done) | `Next: /fab:review` |
   | `review` (done) | `Next: /fab:archive` |
   | `review` (failed) | `Next: /fab:review (re-review after fixes)` |

---

## Stage Number Mapping

Map stages to their numeric position for the `(N/7)` display:

| Stage | Number |
|-------|--------|
| `proposal` | 1 |
| `specs` | 2 |
| `plan` | 3 |
| `tasks` | 4 |
| `apply` | 5 |
| `review` | 6 |
| `archive` | 7 |

---

## Output

### Successful Switch

```
fab/current now points to 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug

Stage:  apply (5/7)
Branch: fix/checkout-bug

Next: /fab:review
```

### No Changes Exist

```
No active changes found. Run /fab:new <description> to start one.
```

### Ambiguous Match

```
Multiple changes match "add":
  1. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: specs)
  2. 260206-a1b2-add-spinner (stage: proposal)

Which change? (1-2)
```

### No Match

```
No change matches "xyz".

Active changes:
  1. 260202-m3x1-fix-checkout-bug (stage: apply)
  2. 260205-k9p2-add-oauth (stage: specs)

Run /fab:switch <name> with a matching name, or pick from the list above (1-2).
```

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No argument and no change folders | Output: "No active changes found. Run /fab:new \<description\> to start one." |
| No argument and changes exist | List all changes with stages, ask user to pick |
| Argument matches exactly one change | Switch to that change |
| Argument matches multiple changes | List matches with stages, ask user to pick |
| Argument matches no changes | List all available changes, inform user |
| Matched change folder missing `.status.yaml` | Switch anyway but warn: "Warning: .status.yaml not found for {name} — change may be corrupted." |
| `fab/changes/` directory does not exist | Output: "fab/changes/ not found. Run /fab:init to set up the project." |
| `fab/current` cannot be written | Report error with details |

---

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Advances stage? | **No** — switch only changes the active pointer, does not modify any change's stage |
| Idempotent? | **Yes** — switching to the same change multiple times has no side effects |
| Modifies `fab/current`? | **Yes** — writes the selected change name |
| Modifies `.status.yaml`? | **No** — read-only access to display status |
| Modifies source code? | **No** |
| Requires config/constitution? | **No** — operates only on `fab/changes/` and `fab/current` |

## Next Steps Reference

After `/fab:switch` completes, the Next line is contextual based on the switched-to change's current stage (see the Suggested next table above).
