> Read and follow the instructions in `fab/.kit/skills/_preamble.md` before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

Detect structural gaps between `docs/memory/` and `docs/specs/` — topics memory covers but specs don't — and propose concise additions back to specs. Top 3 gaps ranked by impact, with exact markdown previews and per-gap user confirmation.

This is the reverse of hydrate (specs → memory): hydrate-specs flows memory → specs.

---

## Arguments

- **`[domain]`** *(optional)* — scope to a single memory domain. If omitted, scans all domains.

---

## Pre-flight

1. `docs/memory/index.md` must exist. If not: STOP with `docs/memory/index.md not found. Run /fab-setup first.`
2. `docs/specs/index.md` must exist. If not: STOP with `docs/specs/index.md not found. Run /fab-setup first.`

---

## Context Loading

Loads `docs/memory/index.md`, `docs/specs/index.md`, all memory files (or scoped domain), and all spec files. Does NOT require `fab/current`, config, or constitution.

---

## Behavior

### Step 1: Build Topic Inventory (Memory)

Read domain indexes and memory files. Extract `##`/`###` headings and brief summaries → list of `(file_path, topic_heading, summary)` tuples.

### Step 2: Build Coverage Inventory (Specs)

Read spec files. Extract headings and inline key term mentions.

### Step 3: Cross-Reference for Gaps

A topic is a **structural gap** if no spec heading covers it AND no spec mentions its key terms inline. Exclude topics that are purely implementation detail.

### Step 4: Rank and Cap

Rank by impact (High: core behavioral rules, design decisions; Medium: supporting concepts; Low: implementation details). Take top 3. Note overflow count.

### Step 5: Present Gaps with Previews

For each gap:

```
### Gap {N}: {topic name}

**Source**: `{memory_file}` → {heading}
**Target**: `{spec_file}` → after {section}

**Preview**:
{exact markdown to insert — matching target file's tone, style, heading levels}

Add this to `{spec_file}`? (yes / no / done)
```

### Step 6: Interactive Confirmation

- **yes** → insert at specified location (preserve existing content)
- **no** → skip, show next
- **done** / **skip rest** → proceed to summary

### Step 7: Summary

`Hydrate-specs complete: {N} of {M} gaps applied.` + overflow note if applicable. No gaps: `No structural gaps found between memory and specs.`

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `docs/memory/index.md` missing | Abort with init guidance |
| `docs/specs/index.md` missing | Abort with init guidance |
| No memory domains found | "No memory domains found. Run /docs-hydrate-memory first." |
| No spec files found | "No spec files found in docs/specs/index.md." |
| Domain argument unmatched | "Domain '{name}' not found. Available: {list}" |
| Spec file write fails | Report error, continue to next gap |
