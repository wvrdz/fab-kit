# /fab-discuss

> Read and follow the instructions in `fab/.kit/skills/_preamble.md` before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

Prime the agent with project context for an exploratory discussion session. Loads the standard always-load layer (`_preamble.md` §1), presents an orientation summary of the project landscape, and signals readiness for open-ended conversation. No artifact generation, no stage advancement — purely read-only.

---

## Arguments

None.

---

## Context Loading

Load the **always-load layer** from `_preamble.md` §1 — the same 7 files every skill loads:

1. `fab/project/config.yaml` — **required**
2. `fab/project/constitution.md` — **required**
3. `fab/project/context.md` — *optional* (skip gracefully if missing)
4. `fab/project/code-quality.md` — *optional* (skip gracefully if missing)
5. `fab/project/code-review.md` — *optional* (skip gracefully if missing)
6. `docs/memory/index.md` — **required**
7. `docs/specs/index.md` — **required**

Do **not** run preflight. Do **not** load change-specific artifacts.

After loading the always-load layer, check for an active change:

1. Read `fab/current` — if the file does not exist or is empty, note "No active change"
2. If `fab/current` contains a change name, read `fab/changes/{name}/.status.yaml` to get the current stage
3. Do **not** load change artifacts (intake, spec, tasks)

---

## Behavior

1. Read all 7 always-load files (skip optional files gracefully)
2. Read `fab/current` for active change awareness
3. Output the **Orientation Summary** (see format below)

---

## Orientation Summary

```
Project: {name} — {description}

Memory domains:
  {domain} ({N} files)
  ...

Specs:
  {spec-name} — {description}
  ...

{Optional files loaded / not found}

Active change: {name} (stage: {stage})  — or "No active change"

Ready to discuss. What would you like to explore?
```

The summary:
- Lists memory domains and file counts from `docs/memory/index.md`
- Lists specs and descriptions from `docs/specs/index.md`
- Notes which optional project files were loaded or not found
- Shows the active change name and stage if one exists (light touch — no deep loading)
- Ends with the ready signal, not a `Next:` pipeline command

| Runs preflight? | No |
| Read-only? | Yes — modifies no files |
