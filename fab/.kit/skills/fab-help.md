# /fab-help

---

## Purpose

Orient the user in the fab workflow. Show how the stages fit together and list every `/fab-*` command with a one-line description. Read-only — no files are created or modified.

---

## Behavior

When invoked, execute the help script and display its output:

```bash
bash fab/.kit/scripts/fab-help.sh
```

The script reads the kit version from `fab/.kit/VERSION` (falling back to "unknown" if missing) and prints the complete help text. The script is the single source of truth for help content.

---

## Context Loading

This skill uses **no context** — it does not load `fab/project/config.yaml`, `fab/project/constitution.md`, or any change artifacts. The only file read is `fab/.kit/VERSION` (by the script).
