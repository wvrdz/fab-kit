# Design Index

> **Design documents are pre-implementation artifacts** — what you *planned*. They capture conceptual
> design intent, high-level decisions, and the "why" behind features. Design docs are human-curated,
> flat in structure, and deliberately size-controlled for quick reading.
>
> Contrast with [`fab/docs/index.md`](../docs/index.md): docs are *post-implementation* —
> what actually happened. Docs are the authoritative source of truth for system behavior,
> maintained by `/fab-archive` hydration.
>
> **Ownership**: Design docs are written and maintained by humans. No automated tooling creates or
> enforces structure here — organize files however makes sense for your project.

> **New here?** See the [Documentation Map](../../README.md#documentation-map) for recommended reading order. For terminology, see the [Glossary](glossary.md).
