# Distribution

**Domain**: fab-workflow

## Overview

How `fab/.kit/` is distributed to new and existing projects. Covers the bootstrap process (getting `.kit/` into a project for the first time), the update mechanism (pulling new versions into an existing project), the release workflow (version management via `release.sh`, build recipes via `justfile`, CI orchestration via `.github/workflows/release.yml` — producing per-platform archives with Go binaries), the backend override mechanism, and the repo rename from `docs-sddr` to `fab-kit`.

## Requirements

### Bootstrap

#### One-Liner Bootstrap

New projects SHALL be bootstrappable via a single curl command that downloads a kit archive from GitHub Releases and extracts it into `fab/.kit/`.

**With compiled backend** (recommended — auto-detects platform via `uname`):
```
os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'); arch=$(uname -m); case "$arch" in x86_64) arch=amd64;; aarch64) arch=arm64;; esac
mkdir -p fab; curl -sL "https://github.com/{repo}/releases/latest/download/kit-${os}-${arch}.tar.gz" | tar xz -C fab/
```

**Generic** (shell scripts only, no binary):
```
mkdir -p fab
gh release download --repo {repo} --pattern 'kit.tar.gz' --output - | tar xz -C fab/
```

Where `{repo}` is the `repo` value from `fab/.kit/kit.conf` (e.g. `wvrdz/fab-kit`). The platform-aware one-liner detects OS and architecture at runtime (`uname -s`, `uname -m`) and downloads the matching `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz` archive which includes all pre-compiled binaries (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) at `fab/.kit/bin/`.

After extraction, the user MUST run `fab/.kit/scripts/fab-sync.sh` to validate prerequisites (`yq`, `jq`, `gh`, `direnv`), create directories (`changes/`, `memory/`, `specs/`), skeleton files (copied from `scaffold/memory-index.md` and `scaffold/specs-index.md`), deploy skills conditionally to detected agents (copies for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI; symlinks for OpenCode — only when the agent's CLI is found in PATH), `.envrc` entries (from `scaffold/envrc`, line-ensuring), `.gitignore` entries (from `scaffold/gitignore-entries`), and register Claude Code hooks from `fab/.kit/hooks/` into `.claude/settings.local.json`. The bootstrap only provides `.kit/` — no `config.yaml`, `constitution.md`, or other project files.

**Scenarios**:
- Bootstrap with compiled backend (platform-aware one-liner) — downloads `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz`, creates `fab/.kit/` with all skills, templates, scripts, VERSION file, and all three binaries (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) at `fab/.kit/bin/`; running `fab-sync.sh` first validates prerequisites (yq, jq, gh, direnv), then creates `changes/`, `memory/index.md`, `specs/index.md`, skill deployments conditionally per detected agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI — only when the agent's CLI command is found in PATH), `.envrc` (line-ensuring from scaffold), and `.gitignore` entry.
- Bootstrap without compiled backend (generic one-liner) — downloads `kit.tar.gz`, creates `fab/.kit/` with skills, templates, and utility scripts but no compiled backend; the `fab` command will not work until a backend is installed (via `fab-sync.sh` step 4 or manual build)
- Bootstrap a new project (no `fab/` directory) — creates `fab/.kit/` with all skills, templates, scripts, and VERSION file; same sync behavior as above
- Bootstrap with existing `fab/` directory — creates or replaces `fab/.kit/`; existing files outside `.kit/` (config.yaml, constitution.md, memory/, specs/, changes/) are NOT affected

#### Manual Copy Still Works

The existing `cp -r` distribution method SHALL continue to work. The bootstrap one-liner is an additive convenience, not a replacement.

**Scenario**: Manual copy (`cp -r /path/to/fab-kit/fab/.kit fab/.kit`) produces an identical result to the curl bootstrap.

### Update

#### Update Script (`fab-upgrade.sh`)

`fab/.kit/scripts/fab-upgrade.sh` SHALL detect the current platform via `uname -s` (OS) and `uname -m` (architecture, with `x86_64`→`amd64` and `aarch64`→`arm64` normalization), attempt to download the platform-specific `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz` from GitHub Releases, fall back to the generic `kit.tar.gz` if the platform archive is not available, extract it to replace the current `fab/.kit/` contents, display the version change, report whether the Go binary is included, and re-run `fab-sync.sh` to repair directories and skill deployments.

The script accepts an optional positional argument — a release tag (e.g., `v0.24.0`) — to download a specific version instead of latest. The tag is passed as-is to `gh release download "$tag"`, with no normalization or `v`-prefix stripping.

**Scenarios**:
- Update to a newer version (platform archive available) — downloads `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz`, replaces `.kit/` contents including `bin/fab` Go binary, displays version change (e.g., "0.1.0 → 0.2.0"), reports "Go binary: included ({os}/{arch})", re-runs `fab-sync.sh`, checks for version drift and prints `/fab-setup migrations` reminder if needed, preserves all files outside `.kit/`
- Update with platform archive unavailable — falls back to generic `kit.tar.gz` with message "Platform {os}/{arch} not available, using generic archive", reports "Go binary: not included (shell scripts only)"
- Update to a specific version (`fab-upgrade.sh v0.24.0`) — downloads and installs the exact tagged release; no version comparison or downgrade warning
- Already up to date — informs user ("Already on the latest version"), no files modified
- Already on the requested tag — informs user ("Already on v0.24.0 (0.24.0)"), no files modified
- Tag not found — exits non-zero with error including the tag and a hint: `Check that the tag exists: gh release view $tag --repo $repo`
- No network access — exits non-zero with error message, existing `.kit/` unchanged
- `fab/.kit-migration-version` missing after upgrade — prints guidance to run `/fab-setup` then `/fab-setup migrations`
- `fab/.kit-migration-version` behind new engine version — prints reminder to run `/fab-setup migrations` to apply migrations

#### Update Preserves Project Files

`fab-upgrade.sh` MUST NOT modify any files outside of `fab/.kit/`. Preserved: `fab/project/config.yaml`, `fab/project/constitution.md`, `fab/.kit-migration-version`, `fab/.kit-sync-version`, `docs/memory/`, `docs/specs/`, `fab/changes/`, `.fab-status.yaml`.

### Sync Staleness Detection

`fab-sync.sh` writes `fab/.kit-sync-version` after skill deployment — a gitignored stamp file containing the `fab/.kit/VERSION` value at sync time. `lib/preflight.sh` compares this stamp against the current kit VERSION and emits a non-blocking stderr warning when they differ:

- `⚠ Skills out of sync — run fab-sync.sh to refresh (engine X, last synced Y)` — when stamp is behind
- `⚠ Skills may be out of sync — run fab-sync.sh to refresh` — when stamp is missing

This detects stale local skill deployments when a developer pulls new `fab/.kit/` source via git but hasn't re-run `fab-sync.sh` (since `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.opencode/` are gitignored and not updated by git pull).

#### gh CLI as Primary Download Tool

`fab-upgrade.sh` SHALL use `gh release download` as the primary method to download the release asset. If `gh` is not installed, the script exits with an error directing the user to install it. Curl fallback is deferred to a future enhancement.

#### Atomic Update

`fab-upgrade.sh` SHALL use an atomic update strategy: extract `kit.tar.gz` to a temporary directory, verify the extraction succeeded (checks for VERSION file), then replace the existing `fab/.kit/` via `rm -rf` and `mv`. This prevents corruption if interrupted mid-extraction.

**Scenarios**:
- Interrupted during download — existing `.kit/` unchanged
- Interrupted during extraction to temp dir — existing `.kit/` unchanged, temp dir cleaned up on next run
- Extraction verification fails — aborts without replacing `.kit/`, displays error

#### Skill Deployment Repair After Update

After extracting the new `.kit/` contents, `fab-upgrade.sh` SHALL re-run `fab-sync.sh` to ensure all skill deployments are up to date: copies refreshed (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`), symlinks valid (`.opencode/commands/`), and stale agent files cleaned up (`.claude/agents/`).

### Release

Release is split across three components: `release.sh` handles version management and git operations, a `justfile` at repo root provides locally-replicable build recipes, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` orchestrates CI. The key principle: CI uses the exact same `just` commands a developer runs locally — no CI-only build logic.

#### Release Script (`release.sh`)

`scripts/release.sh` handles version bumping, migration validation, and git commit/tag/push. It does NOT cross-compile, package archives, or create GitHub Releases — those responsibilities moved to the justfile and CI workflow.

The script accepts a bump type argument (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) that is required to perform a release. When invoked with no arguments, the script displays usage and exits successfully. Unknown arguments produce an error.

The script pushes to the current branch (via `git branch --show-current`) rather than hardcoded `main`. On `main`, behavior is identical to before. On a release branch (e.g., `release/0.25`), commits and tags are pushed to that branch. The tag push triggers CI to handle cross-compilation, packaging, and GitHub Release creation.

After bumping VERSION, the script validates the migration chain: warns if no migration file targets the new version (reminder for release authors), and warns if overlapping migration ranges are detected. These are warnings only — they do not block the release.

Pre-flight checks: clean working tree (error if dirty), `fab/.kit/VERSION` exists (error if missing). The script does NOT check for `gh` CLI or Go toolchain — those are no longer needed locally for releasing.

**Scenarios**:
- Default patch release — bumps patch version (e.g., "0.34.0" → "0.34.1"), commits VERSION bump with message `release: v0.34.1`, creates tag `v0.34.1`, pushes commit and tag to current branch; CI takes over from the tag push
- Minor release (`release.sh minor`) — bumps minor version (e.g., "0.34.1" → "0.35.0")
- Major release (`release.sh major`) — bumps major version (e.g., "0.35.0" → "1.0.0")
- Backport release — on branch `release/0.34`, `release.sh patch` bumps 0.34.1→0.34.2, pushes to `release/0.34`, tags `v0.34.2`; CI creates the release, and GitHub's semver ordering ensures the backport is not marked as "latest"
- Backport workflow — `git checkout -b release/0.34 v0.34.1`, cherry-pick fixes, `release.sh patch` bumps and pushes to `release/0.34`, CI handles the rest
- Invalid bump argument — exits with error message listing valid options
- Unknown argument — exits with error listing valid options
- No git remote configured — exits with error
- Dirty working tree — aborts with error directing user to commit or stash

#### Build Recipes (`justfile`)

The `justfile` at repo root provides locally-replicable build recipes using [just](https://github.com/casey/just). These same recipes are invoked by CI.

**Development recipes**:
- **`build`** — compiles all three binaries (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) for the current platform at `fab/.kit/bin/` using `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- **`test`** — runs all unit tests across all Go modules
- **`test-v`** — runs all unit tests (verbose)
- **`doctor`** — checks prerequisites and environment health

**Release recipes**:
- **`release [bump]`** — bumps VERSION (default: patch), commits, tags, and pushes; CI handles the rest
- **`build-target os arch`** — cross-compiles all three binaries (`fab`, `idea`, `wt`) for a specific platform, outputs to `.release-build/{name}-{os}-{arch}` using `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS={os} GOARCH={arch}`
- **`build-all`** — cross-compiles for all 4 release targets (`darwin/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/amd64`), producing 12 binaries total (3 per platform)
- **`package-kit`** — creates 5 tar.gz archives: generic `kit.tar.gz` (no binaries) + 4 per-platform `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz` (with `fab-go`, `idea`, and `wt`). Verifies all cross-compiled binaries exist first. Uses `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` to suppress macOS extended attributes. Archives are rooted at `.kit/`.
- **`clean`** — removes `.release-build/` directory and all `kit*.tar.gz` files from repo root

**Scenarios**:
- Local dev build (`just build`) — compiles all three binaries (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) for current platform at `fab/.kit/bin/`
- Cross-compile for a single target (`just build-target darwin arm64`) — produces `.release-build/fab-darwin-arm64`, `.release-build/idea-darwin-arm64`, `.release-build/wt-darwin-arm64`
- Build all targets (`just build-all`) — produces 12 binaries in `.release-build/` (3 per platform x 4 platforms)
- Package after build (`just package-kit`) — creates 5 archives in repo root; per-platform archives include `.kit/bin/fab-go`, `.kit/bin/idea`, and `.kit/bin/wt`, generic archive includes none
- Package without prior build (`just package-kit`) — fails with error directing to run `just build-all` first
- Clean up (`just clean`) — removes `.release-build/` and `kit*.tar.gz`

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is a GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push of tags matching `v*`. It runs on a single `ubuntu-latest` runner and uses the same `just` recipes as local development.

Workflow steps:
1. Checkout repository (`actions/checkout@v4`)
2. Set up Go toolchain (`actions/setup-go@v5`, Go 1.22)
3. Install `just` command runner (`extractions/setup-just@v2`)
4. Run `just build-all` (cross-compiles all 12 targets: 3 binaries x 4 platforms)
5. Run `just package-kit` (creates 5 archives with three binaries per platform)
6. Create GitHub Release via `gh release create` with all 5 archives and commit-level changelog (minor releases cumulate all commits since the previous minor; patch releases show commits since the previous release)

The workflow sets `permissions: contents: write` for release creation. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used implicitly by `gh`.

GitHub determines "latest" release status based on semver ordering — backport releases for older version series (e.g., `v0.34.2` when `v0.35.0` exists) are not marked as latest automatically. For edge cases, use `gh release edit $TAG --latest=false` after CI creates the release.

**Scenarios**:
- Tag push triggers workflow — push of `v0.35.0` tag triggers the release workflow
- Non-tag push does not trigger — regular commits pushed without a `v*` tag do not run the workflow
- Full CI release — tag `v0.35.0` triggers workflow, which cross-compiles all Go binaries (12 total: fab, idea, wt x 4 platforms), packages 5 archives (3 binaries per platform), and creates a GitHub Release with commit-level changelog
- Backport release via CI — tag `v0.34.2` triggers workflow; GitHub's semver ordering ensures it is not marked as "latest" since `v0.35.0` exists

#### Release Archive Contents

Each release produces 5 archives, all rooted at `.kit/` (e.g., `.kit/VERSION`, `.kit/skills/fab-new.md`, `.kit/packages/idea/bin/idea`):

- **`kit.tar.gz`** — Generic archive containing shell scripts, skills, templates, packages, and all non-binary `.kit/` contents. No compiled binaries included. Serves as a fallback for unsupported platforms.
- **`kit-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`** — Generic contents + three binaries at `.kit/bin/` (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) compiled for macOS Apple Silicon.
- **`kit-darwin-amd64.tar.gz`** — Generic contents + three binaries at `.kit/bin/` (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) compiled for macOS Intel.
- **`kit-linux-arm64.tar.gz`** — Generic contents + three binaries at `.kit/bin/` (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) compiled for Linux ARM64 (musl, fully static).
- **`kit-linux-amd64.tar.gz`** — Generic contents + three binaries at `.kit/bin/` (`fab-go`, `idea`, `wt`) compiled for Linux x86-64 (musl, fully static).

No project-specific files (config.yaml, constitution.md, memory/, specs/, changes/) are included in any archive. Package production code (idea only — wt is now a binary in `bin/`) is included under `.kit/packages/`, hook scripts under `.kit/hooks/`, and sync scripts under `.kit/sync/` — all delivered to downstream projects on upgrade. `idea` is a standalone binary at `.kit/bin/idea` (not a `fab` subcommand); it operates on the current worktree's `fab/backlog.md` by default, or the main worktree's backlog when `--main` is passed. The shell package at `.kit/packages/idea/bin/idea` is retained for rollback safety and generic-archive users. Skill files under `.kit/skills/` (including `fab-operator1.md`) are included in all archives and deployed to agents by `fab-sync.sh`. Three binaries are placed at `.kit/bin/fab-go`, `.kit/bin/idea`, and `.kit/bin/wt` in platform archives; the `bin/` directory contains a `.gitkeep` to ensure the directory exists even in the generic archive.

### Backend Override Mechanism

The `fab/.kit/bin/fab` dispatcher supports a backend override mechanism via environment variable or file.

**Priority chain** (first match wins):
1. `FAB_BACKEND` environment variable — per-command override (e.g., `FAB_BACKEND=go fab resolve`)
2. `.fab-backend` file at repo root — persistent project-level override (contains `go`, whitespace trimmed)
3. Default — `fab-go`

**`.fab-backend` file**: Lives at the repo root (three levels up from `fab/.kit/bin/`), gitignored, contains a single word: `go`. Created manually by the developer.

**Fallthrough behavior**: Invalid override values (e.g., `FAB_BACKEND=python`) and overrides pointing to unavailable backends silently fall through to the default. This prevents lockout if the file has a typo.

**Scenarios**:
- `FAB_BACKEND=go fab resolve` — invokes Go backend for a single command
- `echo "go" > .fab-backend` — persistent Go backend for all commands in this repo
- `FAB_BACKEND=python` — unrecognized, falls through to default (Go)

### Repo Rename

The repository SHALL be renamed from `docs-sddr` to `fab-kit` to reflect its role as the canonical source for `fab/.kit/`. GitHub auto-redirects handle existing URLs and clones.

**Scenarios**:
- Old URLs (`github.com/wvrdz/docs-sddr`) redirect to the current repo URL
- Existing clones with old remote URL continue to work via redirect

## Design Decisions

- **CI/local parity via justfile (260307-ma7o-1)**: Build recipes live in the `justfile` so CI and local development use identical commands (`just build-all`, `just package-kit`). No CI-only build scripts or logic. This makes CI behavior fully reproducible locally.
- **Three-way release split (260307-ma7o-1)**: `release.sh` owns version/tag/push, `justfile` owns build/package, `.github/workflows/release.yml` owns orchestration. Each component has a single responsibility and can be tested independently.
- **GitHub semver ordering replaces `--no-latest` (260307-ma7o-1)**: GitHub automatically determines "latest" release based on semver. Backport releases (e.g., `v0.34.2` when `v0.35.0` exists) are not marked latest. The `--no-latest` flag was removed from `release.sh` — no flag to remember, no CI mechanism to pass it through. For edge cases, `gh release edit` can be used post-creation.
- **Commit-level release notes with minor cumulation**: CI generates release notes from `git log --oneline` with linked commit SHAs. Minor releases (x.y.0) cumulate all commits since the previous minor tag, giving a complete picture of the release cycle. Patch releases show commits since the previous release only. Major releases use the same patch-style diff (manual curation expected for milestone releases).
- **Backend override via env var + file (260307-bmp3-3)**: `FAB_BACKEND` env var and `.fab-backend` file provide a way to select the backend. Env var for per-command overrides, file for persistent project-level preference. Invalid/unavailable values fall through to the default (no lockout). Rejected: CLI flag (would require dispatcher to parse args before delegating).

## Changelog

| Change | Date | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| 260320-9tqo-fix-idea-docs-main-flag | 2026-03-20 | Corrected `idea` documentation: moved Backlog section from `_cli-fab.md` to `_cli-external.md`, fixed invocation from `fab idea` to standalone `fab/.kit/bin/idea`. Added `--main` persistent flag — default now uses current worktree (`--show-toplevel`), `--main` opts into main worktree (`--git-common-dir`). Renamed `GitRepoRoot()` to `MainRepoRoot()`, added `WorktreeRoot()`. Updated `_cli-external.md` frontmatter and `docs/specs/packages.md`. |
| 260312-96nf-remove-rust-implementation | 2026-03-12 | Removed all Rust references from distribution docs. Removed Rust recipes from build recipes section, Rust CI steps (toolchain, Zig, cargo-zigbuild), Rust from archive descriptions (3→2 binaries per platform, 12→8 total). Updated backend override to Go-only. Removed "Transition Period: Dual Backends" section. Updated bootstrap descriptions, packaging scenarios, and CI workflow steps. Removed cargo-zigbuild design decision. |
| 260310-8m3k-port-wt-tests-cleanup-legacy | 2026-03-10 | Removed `src/packages/` (legacy shell wt package and bats tests), `src/tests/` (bats submodule libs), and `.gitmodules` (bats submodule refs only). Ported 73 behavioral tests from bats to Go in `src/go/wt/cmd/*_test.go`. Removed `bats` from prerequisites description (already absent from actual sync scripts). Removed `test-setup` and `test-packages` justfile targets and their backing scripts (`scripts/just/test-setup.sh`, `test-packages.sh`). |
| 260310-qbiq-go-wt-binary | 2026-03-10 | Per-platform archives now include `wt` binary at `.kit/bin/wt` alongside `fab-go` and `fab-rust` (3 binaries per platform, 12 total cross-compiled). Added justfile recipes: `build-wt`, `build-wt-target`, `build-wt-all`. Updated `build-all` to include wt. Updated `package-kit` to verify and include wt binary. `fab/.kit/packages/wt/` removed — wt is a binary, not a shell package. `env-packages.sh` already adds `$KIT_DIR/bin` to PATH — no change needed for wt binary availability. |
| 260310-pl72-port-idea-to-go | 2026-03-10 | `idea` is now available as `fab idea` via the Go binary (in per-platform archives), in addition to the shell package at `.kit/packages/idea/bin/idea`. Both coexist — shell package retained for rollback safety and generic-archive users. |
| 260307-buf0-4-rust-ci-build | 2026-03-10 | Releases now ship both Go and Rust binaries. Added Rust cross-compilation recipes to justfile (`build-rust-target`, `build-rust-all`, `build-all`, `_rust-target`). Updated `package-kit` to include both `fab-go` and `fab-rust` in per-platform archives and exclude both from generic archive. CI workflow updated with Rust toolchain (`dtolnay/rust-toolchain`), Zig (`pip install ziglang`), `cargo-zigbuild`, and cached tool installations. `build-go-all` → `build-all` in CI. Linux Rust targets use musl for fully static binaries. |
| 260307-bmp3-3-rust-binary-port | 2026-03-10 | Added backend override mechanism (`FAB_BACKEND` env var, `.fab-backend` file) to dispatcher for switching between Rust and Go backends. Documented transition period where both binaries coexist — Rust preferred by default, Go shipped in release archives, Rust built locally via `just build-rust`. CI/release for Rust deferred. Updated bootstrap one-liners to reference both backends. |
| 260307-ma7o-1-ci-releases-justfile | 2026-03-09 | Split release workflow into three components: `release.sh` simplified to version bump + git commit/tag/push only (~60 lines, removed ~200 lines of build/package/release logic). New `justfile` at repo root provides build recipes (`build-go`, `build-go-target`, `build-go-all`, `package-kit`, `clean`) replicable locally and in CI. New `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on `v*` tag push — uses `just` recipes on single `ubuntu-latest` runner, creates GitHub Release with auto-generated notes. Removed `--no-latest` flag (GitHub's semver ordering handles backport "latest" status). Removed Go toolchain and `gh` CLI checks from release script. |
| 260306-qkov-operator1-skill | 2026-03-07 | Noted that `fab-operator1.md` ships as part of the kit skills directory in all archives — no new distribution mechanics, just another skill file deployed by `fab-sync.sh`. |
| 260305-u8t9-clean-break-go-only | 2026-03-05 | Updated generic archive (shell-only) scenario: no longer provides a working `fab` command — Go binary is required. Shell script fallback removed from dispatcher. |
| 260305-bs5x-orchestrator-idle-hooks | 2026-03-05 | Added `fab/.kit/hooks/` as a new distributed directory (hook scripts shipped with kit). Updated bootstrap description to mention hook registration via `5-sync-hooks.sh`. Updated release archive contents to note hooks and sync scripts alongside packages. |
| 260305-g0uq-2-ship-fab-go-binary | 2026-03-05 | Ship fab Go binary: release now produces 5 archives (generic `kit.tar.gz` + 4 per-platform `kit-{os}-{arch}.tar.gz` with Go binary at `.kit/bin/fab`). `release.sh` cross-compiles via `CGO_ENABLED=0` for darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/amd64. `fab-upgrade.sh` detects platform via `uname -s`/`uname -m`, downloads platform archive with fallback to generic. README bootstrap one-liner is now platform-aware. Shell scripts in `lib/` have shim layer that delegates to Go binary when present. Skills updated via `_cli-fab.md` (renamed from `_scripts.md`) to invoke `fab/.kit/bin/fab` as primary calling convention. |
| 260305-bhd6-1-build-fab-go-binary | 2026-03-05 | Go binary (`src/go/fab/`) built — ports all lib/ scripts to single `fab` binary. No distribution changes in this change — binary inclusion in kit.tar.gz and per-platform archives are deferred to a future change. Go toolchain required only for building from source, not for end users. |
| 260303-l6nk-gemini-cli-agent-aware-sync | 2026-03-04 | Added Gemini CLI as 4th supported agent. Updated bootstrap/sync descriptions to reflect conditional agent deployment (skills deployed only when agent's CLI found in PATH). Four agents: Claude Code (copies), OpenCode (symlinks), Codex (copies), Gemini CLI (copies). |
| 260301-08pa-version-pinned-upgrade-and-release | 2026-03-02 | Added version-pinned upgrade (`fab-upgrade.sh v0.24.0`) with tag-aware messaging. Added backport release support to `release.sh`: push to current branch instead of hardcoded `main`, `--no-latest` flag for `gh release create --latest=false`, position-independent argument parsing. |
| 260226-koj1-version-staleness-warning | 2026-02-26 | Added sync staleness detection (`fab/.kit-sync-version` stamp, preflight stderr warning). Renamed `fab/project/VERSION` → `fab/.kit-migration-version`. Updated preserved files list in upgrade section. |
| 260224-v40o-wt-drop-prefix-and-dotworktrees | 2026-02-25 | wt package: dropped `wt/` branch prefix from exploratory worktrees (branch = worktree name directly). Switched worktree home directory from `<repo>-worktrees` to `<repo>.worktrees` (GitLens convention). Updated `wt-create` help text. No migration for existing worktrees. |
| 260221-i0z6-move-env-packages-add-fab-pipeline | 2026-02-21 | `env-packages.sh` moved from `scripts/` to `scripts/lib/` — now sourced from `fab/.kit/scripts/lib/env-packages.sh` in both `scaffold/fragment-.envrc` and `src/packages/rc-init.sh` |
| 260219-d2y2-copy-template-skills-drop-agents | 2026-02-19 | Updated references from symlinks to copies for Claude Code skills. Renamed "Symlink Repair After Update" to "Skill Deployment Repair After Update". Updated bootstrap and upgrade descriptions to reflect copy-with-template deployment |
| 260218-cif4-eliminate-symlinks-distribute-packages | 2026-02-18 | Package production code (idea, wt) now distributed via `kit.tar.gz` under `.kit/packages/`. Updated release archive contents description. Updated `fab-upgrade.sh` description (symlinks → directories and agents).
