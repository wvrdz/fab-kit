# Specs Index

**Domain**: fab-workflow

## Overview

`docs/specs/index.md` is the centralized index for pre-implementation specifications. It complements `docs/memory/index.md` (post-implementation truth) by providing a persistent home for design intent — what was planned, the "why" behind features.

## Requirements

### Specs vs Memory Distinction

Spec files are pre-implementation artifacts — what you planned. They capture conceptual design intent, high-level decisions, and the "why" behind features. Memory files are post-implementation artifacts — what actually happened, the authoritative source of truth for system behavior.

- `docs/specs/index.md` boilerplate clearly states spec files are pre-implementation / planning artifacts
- `docs/memory/index.md` boilerplate clearly states memory files are post-implementation / authoritative truth
- Both index files cross-reference each other with relative links

### Flat Structure

The specs index does not prescribe a domain-based directory hierarchy. Spec files may be organized by the human in any structure they choose. The index simply lists what exists.

### Human-Curated Ownership

Spec files are written and maintained by humans. No automated tooling creates or enforces structure in `docs/specs/`. `/docs-hydrate-specs` provides assisted reverse-hydration — it identifies structural gaps between memory and specs and proposes concise additions, but every insertion requires explicit user confirmation. Spec files remain human-curated.

### Bootstrap Integration

`/fab-setup` creates `docs/specs/index.md` during structural bootstrap (after memory/index.md). The creation is idempotent — if the file already exists, setup skips it with a status message.

### Context Loading Integration

`docs/specs/index.md` is included in the "Always Load" context layer in `_preamble.md`, alongside `config.yaml`, `constitution.md`, and `docs/memory/index.md`. This gives every skill baseline awareness of the specs landscape.
