# Specs Index

> **Specs are pre-implementation artifacts** — what you *planned*. They capture conceptual
> design intent, high-level decisions, and the "why" behind features. Specs are human-curated,
> flat in structure, and deliberately size-controlled for quick reading.
>
> Contrast with [`docs/memory/index.md`](../memory/index.md): memory files are *post-implementation* —
> what actually happened. Memory is the authoritative source of truth for system behavior,
> maintained by `/fab-continue` (archive) hydration.
>
> **Ownership**: Specs are written and maintained by humans. No automated tooling creates or
> enforces structure here — organize files however makes sense for your project.

> **New here?** Start with the [README](../../README.md) for setup and a walkthrough. For terminology, see the [Glossary](glossary.md).
