# Packages

Fab Kit ships two standalone CLI packages alongside the skill-based pipeline. Unlike skills (which are Claude Code prompts invoked via `/`), packages are plain shell scripts that run directly in the terminal — no AI agent required.

Both packages live inside `fab/.kit/packages/` and are added to PATH via `env-packages.sh` during workspace setup. They complement the fab pipeline: **wt** provides the worktree isolation that enables parallel changes, and **idea** provides the backlog that feeds `/fab-new`.

## wt (Worktree Management)

Git worktrees let you have multiple checkouts of the same repository side by side. The wt package wraps `git worktree` with opinionated defaults for the fab workflow: worktrees are created as siblings in `<repo>.worktrees/`, names are memorable random words, and each worktree can run its own fab change independently.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wt-create` | Create a git worktree for parallel development |
| `wt-list` | List all git worktrees for the current repository |
| `wt-open` | Open a git worktree in an editor, terminal, or file manager |
| `wt-delete` | Delete a git worktree with optional branch cleanup |
| `wt-init` | Run the init script for the current worktree |
| `wt-pr` | Create a git worktree for reviewing a GitHub pull request |

Run `<command> help` for full usage details.

### Integration with Fab

The wt package is the foundation of the [assembly-line pattern](assembly-line.md). Each fab change gets its own worktree, enabling parallel AI sessions — one tmux tab per change, zero conflicts between them.

The batch scripts orchestrate this at scale:

- **`batch-fab-new-backlog`** — Creates a worktree per backlog item, opens tmux tabs, runs `/fab-new` in each
- **`batch-fab-switch-change`** — Creates a worktree per existing change, opens tmux tabs with Claude sessions
- **`batch-fab-archive-change`** — Archives completed changes across worktrees

### Common Workflows

**Start a new change in isolation:**
```bash
wt-create                    # Creates a worktree with a random name
cd ../repo.worktrees/name/   # Enter the worktree
# Work on your change — main repo is untouched
```

**Review a pull request:**
```bash
wt-pr 42                     # Creates a worktree checked out to PR #42's branch
# Review, test, comment — then wt-delete to clean up
```

**Clean up when done:**
```bash
wt-delete                    # Removes the worktree and optionally its branch
```

### Why wt-open Cannot cd in the Current Shell

A frequently requested feature is a "cd here" option in `wt-open` that changes the calling shell's working directory to the worktree path. This is not possible due to a fundamental Unix process model constraint.

**The constraint**: Every shell command (including `wt-open` and `wt-create`) runs as a **child process** of the calling shell. A child process has its own working directory that is independent of its parent. When the child exits, the parent's working directory is unchanged — there is no mechanism for a child process to modify its parent's environment.

This is not a limitation of `wt-open` specifically — it applies to all executables on Unix systems. Only code that runs **within** the shell process itself (shell builtins like `cd`, and shell functions defined via `source` or `.`) can change the shell's working directory.

**Workarounds**: Users who want to navigate to a worktree in their current shell can use:

```bash
# Option 1: Use command substitution with wt-create's stdout path
cd "$(wt-create --non-interactive)"

# Option 2: Copy path from wt-open's "Copy path" menu option, then paste
cd <paste>

# Option 3: Define a shell function in your .bashrc/.zshrc
wt-cd() {
    local path
    path=$(wt-list --path "${1:?worktree name required}") || return $?
    cd "$path" || return $?
}
```

A shell function wrapper like Option 3 works because functions execute in the calling shell's process, not as a child. The function delegates path resolution to `wt-list --path` (which runs as a child) but executes `cd` in the parent shell's context.

**Why we don't ship a shell function**: Shipping a `wt-cd` function would require users to `source` a file from their shell rc (`.bashrc`/`.zshrc`), which is a different distribution model than the current PATH-based approach. `env-packages.sh` adds `bin/` directories to PATH — it doesn't define shell functions. Mixing the two models adds complexity for a convenience that can be achieved with a 4-line function in the user's own rc file.

## idea (Backlog Management)

The idea command manages a per-repo backlog stored in `fab/backlog.md`. It's a lightweight CRUD tool for capturing, triaging, and tracking ideas before they become fab changes.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `idea "text"` | Add a new idea to the backlog |
| `idea list` | List open (uncompleted) ideas |
| `idea show <query>` | Show a single idea matching the query |
| `idea done <query>` | Mark an idea as done |
| `idea reopen <query>` | Reopen a completed idea |
| `idea edit <query> "text"` | Modify an idea's text |
| `idea rm <query>` | Delete an idea |

Each idea gets a short 4-character ID (e.g., `[a7k2]`) and a timestamp. Queries match against IDs or text (substring, case-insensitive).

### Integration with Fab

The idea → fab pipeline:

1. **Capture**: `idea "add retry logic to API client"` — appends to `fab/backlog.md`
2. **Triage**: `idea list` — review open ideas, decide what to build next
3. **Start work**: `/fab-new` can accept a backlog ID to create a change from an idea, pulling the description directly from the backlog
4. **Close**: `idea done a7k2` — marks the idea as completed after the change ships

The `batch-fab-new-backlog` script automates step 3 at scale — it reads all open backlog items and creates a worktree + Claude session per item.

### Common Workflows

**Capture ideas throughout the day:**
```bash
idea "refactor auth middleware to use JWT"
idea "add rate limiting to public endpoints"
idea "update README with new setup instructions"
```

**Triage and start work:**
```bash
idea list                     # Review what's pending
# Pick the ones to work on next
batch-fab-new-backlog --all   # Create changes from all open ideas
```

## Package Architecture

Packages live inside `fab/.kit/packages/`, which means they ship with `kit.tar.gz` and are replaced on `fab-upgrade.sh` runs — same lifecycle as skills and templates.

```
fab/.kit/packages/
├── idea/
│   └── bin/idea              # Single executable
└── wt/
    ├── bin/                  # Executables (wt-create, wt-list, wt-open, wt-delete, wt-init, wt-pr)
    └── lib/wt-common.sh      # Shared library (sourced by bin/ scripts)
```

**Convention**: Each package has a `bin/` directory containing executable commands. Packages with shared logic use a `lib/` directory for sourceable libraries. Commands in `bin/` are the public interface; `lib/` is internal.

**PATH setup**: `fab/.kit/scripts/lib/env-packages.sh` iterates all `fab/.kit/packages/*/bin` directories and adds them to PATH. This script is sourced by `.envrc` (for direnv-based projects) and can be sourced from shell rc files.

**Distribution**: Packages are part of the kit archive — `fab-release.sh` packages them into `kit.tar.gz`, and `fab-upgrade.sh` replaces them atomically alongside skills and templates. No separate installation step.
