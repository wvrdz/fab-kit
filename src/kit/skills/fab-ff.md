description: "Fast-forward through hydrate — confidence-gated pipeline from intake through hydrate, with sub-agent review, auto-rework loop, and stop on exhaustion."

# /fab-ff [<change-name>] [--force]

> Read the `_preamble` skill first (deployed to `.claude/skills/` via `fab sync`). Then follow its instructions before proceeding.

---

## Purpose

Fast-forward through hydrate: intake → spec → tasks → apply → review → hydrate. Three gates where execution can stop: (1) intake gate — indicative confidence >= 3.0, (2) spec gate — confidence >= per-type threshold via `fab score --check-gate`, (3) review gate — stops after 3 autonomous rework cycles. On any gate stop, the user can intervene then re-run. Resumable — re-running picks up from the first incomplete stage.

---

## Arguments

- **`<change-name>`** *(optional)* — target a specific change instead of the active one resolved via `.fab-status.yaml`. Resolution per `_preamble.md` (Change-name override).
- **`--force`** *(optional)* — bypass all confidence gates (intake gate and spec gate). All other behavior (auto-clarify, rework loop, etc.) is unchanged. Output header includes "(force mode -- gates bypassed)".

---

## Pre-flight

1. Run preflight per `_preamble.md` Section 2. Pass `<change-name>` if provided.
2. **Intake prerequisite**: Verify `intake.md` exists. If not, STOP: `Intake not found. Run /fab-new to create the intake first.`
3. **Intake gate** *(skip if `--force`)*: Run `fab score --check-gate --stage intake <change>`. If the gate fails → STOP: `Indicative confidence is {score} of 5.0 (need >= 3.0). Run /fab-clarify to resolve, then retry.`

---

## Context Loading

Load per `_preamble.md` Sections 1-3 (config, constitution, intake, memory index, affected memory files, all completed artifacts).

---

## Behavior

> **Note**: All `.status.yaml` mutations in this skill use `fab status` event commands (`start`, `advance`, `finish`, `reset`, `fail`, `set-checklist`) rather than direct file edits. The driver argument is optional, but this skill always passes `fab-ff`.
>
> **Dispatch**: All sub-skill invocations use the Agent tool (`general-purpose` subagent) per `_preamble.md` § Subagent Dispatch. Each subagent reads the target skill file, follows the specified behavior, and returns a structured result to the pipeline.

### Resumability

Check `progress` from preflight. Skip stages already `done`. If `hydrate: done`, pipeline is already complete.

### Step 1: Generate `spec.md`

*(Skip if `progress.spec` is `done`.)*

Follow **Spec Generation Procedure** (`_generation.md`). No frontloaded questions. Update `.status.yaml` via `fab status finish <change> intake fab-ff`.

**Spec gate** *(skip if `--force`)*: After spec generation, run `fab score --check-gate <change>`. If the gate fails → **STOP**: `Confidence is {score} of 5.0 (need >= {threshold} for {change_type}). Run /fab-clarify to resolve, then retry /fab-ff.`

**Auto-Clarify**: Dispatch `/fab-clarify` as subagent — `[AUTO-MODE]`, target: `spec.md`, change: `{id}`. Returns `{resolved, blocking, non_blocking}`. If `blocking: 0` → continue. If `blocking > 0` → **BAIL**: report blocking issues, suggest `/fab-clarify` then `/fab-ff`.

### Step 2: Generate `tasks.md`

*(Skip if `progress.tasks` is `done`.)*

Follow **Tasks Generation Procedure** (`_generation.md`).

**Auto-Clarify**: Dispatch `/fab-clarify` as subagent — `[AUTO-MODE]`, target: `tasks.md`, change: `{id}`. Same bail logic as Step 1.

### Step 3: Generate Quality Checklist

*(Skip if checklist already generated.)*

Follow **Checklist Generation Procedure** (`_generation.md`).

### Step 4: Update `.status.yaml` (Planning Complete)

Run `fab status finish <change> tasks fab-ff`. Then set checklist fields via `fab status set-checklist <change> generated true`, `fab status set-checklist <change> total <count>`, `fab status set-checklist <change> completed 0`.

### Step 5: Implementation

*(Skip if `progress.apply` is `done`.)*

Dispatch `/fab-continue` as subagent — Apply Behavior, change: `{id}`. The subagent parses unchecked tasks, executes in dependency order, runs tests, and marks `[x]` on completion. Returns completion status or failure with task ID and reason.

**If task fails**: STOP with `Task {ID} failed: {reason}. Investigate and re-run /fab-ff.`

On success: run `fab status finish <change> apply fab-ff`.

### Step 6: Review

*(Skip if `progress.review` is `done`.)*

Dispatch `/fab-continue` as subagent — Review Behavior, change: `{id}`. The subagent reads `_review.md` for review dispatch instructions — both inward and outward sub-agents are defined there. It dispatches both sub-agents in parallel, merges their findings, and returns structured findings (must-fix / should-fix / nice-to-have) with pass/fail status.

**Pass**: run `fab status finish <change> review fab-ff`. Proceed to Step 7.

**Fail**: Auto-rework loop with bounded retry, then interactive fallback. Run `fab status fail <change> review` then `fab status reset <change> apply fab-ff`.

#### Auto-Rework Loop (up to 3 cycles)

The agent triages the sub-agent's prioritized findings and autonomously selects the rework path — no user interaction. Must-fix items are always addressed; should-fix items when clear and low-effort; nice-to-have items may be skipped.

**Decision heuristics** (applied to prioritized findings):
- **Must-fix: test failures, spec mismatches, checklist violations** → "Fix code" — uncheck affected tasks with `<!-- rework: reason -->`, re-run apply, then spawn a **fresh sub-agent** for re-review
- **Must-fix: missing functionality, incomplete coverage, wrong task breakdown** → "Revise tasks" — add/modify tasks in `tasks.md`, re-run apply, then spawn a fresh sub-agent for re-review
- **Must-fix: spec drift, requirements mismatch, fundamental approach issues** → "Revise spec" — reset to spec stage, regenerate downstream, re-run apply, then spawn a fresh sub-agent for re-review

**Escalation rule**: If the agent chooses "Fix code" and the subsequent sub-agent review fails again on the same or similar issues, the agent MUST escalate to "Revise tasks" or "Revise spec" after **2 consecutive "fix code" attempts**. This is a hard rule — the agent SHALL NOT choose "Fix code" a third time in a row, even if it believes another code fix would work. Non-fix-code actions (revise tasks, revise spec) reset the consecutive counter.

#### Stop (after 3 failed cycles)

After 3 auto-rework cycles fail, **STOP** with a per-cycle summary:

```
Review failed after 3 rework attempts. Summary:
  Cycle 1: {action} — {what was done}
  Cycle 2: {action} — {what was done}
  Cycle 3: {action} — {what was done}
Run /fab-continue for manual rework options.
```

The user can run `/fab-continue` for interactive rework, or `/fab-clarify` to deepen the spec/tasks before re-running `/fab-ff`.

### Step 7: Hydrate

*(Skip if `progress.hydrate` is `done`.)*

Dispatch `/fab-continue` as subagent — Hydrate Behavior, change: `{id}`. The subagent validates review passed, hydrates into `docs/memory/`, and runs `fab status finish <change> hydrate fab-ff`. Returns completion status.

---

## Output

```
/fab-ff — confidence {score} of 5.0, gate passed.

--- Planning ---
{tasks + checklist output}

--- Implementation ---
{apply output}

--- Review ---
{review output}

--- Hydrate ---
{hydrate output}

Pipeline complete.

Next: {per state table}
```

Resuming shows `(resuming)...` header and `Skipping {stage} — already done.` for completed stages. Bail/failure stops at the relevant stage with `Next:` derived from the state reached per state table in `_preamble.md`.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Preflight fails | Abort with stderr message |
| `intake.md` missing | Abort: "Intake not found. Run /fab-new first." |
| Intake gate fails (indicative < 3.0) | Stop with score and guidance |
| Spec gate fails (confidence < threshold) | Stop with score, threshold, and guidance |
| Auto-clarify bails | Stop, report blocking issues, suggest `/fab-clarify` then `/fab-ff` |
| Task fails | Stop: "Task {ID} failed: {reason}. Investigate and re-run /fab-ff." |
| Review fails | Auto-rework loop: 3 cycles (each re-review by fresh sub-agent), escalation after 2 consecutive fix-code. Stops after 3 cycles with summary. |
