# /fab-operator

> Read the `_preamble` skill first (deployed to `.claude/skills/` via `fab sync`). Then follow its instructions before proceeding.

Multi-agent coordination layer. Runs in a dedicated tmux pane, observes agents via `fab pane map`, routes commands via `tmux send-keys`, monitors progress via `/loop`. The loop is the heart of the operator.

Start via `fab operator` (singleton tmux tab named `operator`).

---

## 1. Principles

**Coordinate, don't execute.** The operator routes instructions to the right agent — it never implements work directly. If ambiguous, ask. Exception: operational maintenance (merge PR, archive, delete worktree) is executed directly by the operator since these are coordination-level actions, not pipeline work.

**Spawn-in-worktree.** The operator's own pane is reserved for coordination state — pane maps, autopilot queue, `.fab-operator.yaml` bookkeeping. All pipeline work (`/fab-new`, `/fab-proceed`, `/fab-fff`, `/fab-ff`, `/fab-continue`, `/git-branch`, `/git-pr`) MUST run in a freshly spawned agent tab in its own worktree — never in the operator pane itself. The first action for any new request is `wt create --non-interactive`, then spawn the agent tab (see §5). Even a one-liner change gets its own worktree.

**Automate the routine.** The operator exists to take work off the user's hands. Auto-answer prompts, nudge stuck agents, rebase stale PRs, spawn agents from backlog — act on the user's behalf for routine operational decisions. The PR review stage is the safety net. Never ask whether to monitor a spawned agent — if the operator spawned it, monitor it.

**Not a lifecycle enforcer.** Individual agents self-govern via their own pipeline skills. The operator does not validate stage transitions or enforce pipeline rules. If an agent is at an unexpected stage, report it factually.

**Context discipline.** The operator never reads change artifacts (intakes, specs, tasks). Its context window is reserved for coordination state — pane maps, stage snapshots, `.fab-operator.yaml`. This keeps long-running sessions lean.

**State re-derivation.** Before every action, re-query live state via `fab pane map`. Panes die, stages advance, agents finish — stale state leads to wrong actions. Never rely on conversation memory for pane or stage values.

**Self-manage context.** The operator is long-lived. When context approaches capacity, run `/clear` and restart the loop. Continuity is maintained via `.fab-operator.yaml` — the monitored set and autopilot queue survive a clear. After clearing, re-read context files, re-read `.fab-operator.yaml`, and resume.

**Pipeline-first routing.** The operator MUST route all new work through `/fab-new` (to generate intake) then a pipeline command (`/fab-fff`, `/fab-ff`, or `/fab-continue`). The operator MUST NOT dispatch raw inline implementation instructions (e.g., "fix the login bug by changing line 42 in auth.ts") directly to agent panes. The operator MUST NOT send `/fab-continue` to skip intake for new work — `/fab-new` is always the entry point. Exception: operational maintenance commands (see "Coordinate, don't execute" above) are coordination-level actions and remain direct.

---

## 2. Startup

### Context Loading

Load the **always-load layer** from `_preamble.md` §1 (config, constitution, context, code-quality, code-review, memory index, specs index). Do not run preflight. Do not load change artifacts.

Helpers declared in frontmatter: `_cli-fab` (fab command reference) and `_cli-external` (wt, idea, tmux, /loop reference). Naming conventions are inlined in `_preamble.md` § Naming Conventions — already loaded.

The operator needs full command vocabulary to make routing decisions (e.g., knowing a change needs `/fab-new` → `/git-branch` → `/fab-fff`).

After context loading, log the command invocation:

```bash
fab log command "fab-operator" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Tmux Gate

If `$TMUX` is unset, STOP:

```
Error: operator requires tmux. Start a tmux session first.
```

### Init

1. Read `.fab-operator.yaml` from the repo root. If missing, create with empty `monitored: {}`, `autopilot: null`, and `branch_map: {}`
2. Restore monitored set, autopilot queue, and branch_map from the file (supports `/clear` recovery)
3. Run `fab pane map` and display the output
4. If any tracked items exist (monitored changes, active autopilot, or watches), start the loop: `/loop 3m "operator tick"`
5. Output: `Operator ready.` (+ `Loop active (3m).` if loop started)

---

## 3. Safety

### Confirmation Tiers

| Tier | Examples | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| Read-only | Status check, pane map | No confirmation |
| Recoverable | Send `/fab-continue`, rebase | Announce before sending |
| Destructive | Merge PR, archive, delete worktree | Confirm before executing |

### Pre-Send Validation

Before sending keys to any pane:

1. **Verify pane exists** — refresh pane map. If gone: "Pane for {change} is gone." Do not send.
2. **Check agent is idle** — if busy: "{change} is active. Sending may corrupt its work. Send anyway?" Only on explicit confirmation.
3. **Check change is active** — if the target change isn't the active change in that tab, send `/fab-switch <change>` first.
4. **Check branch alignment** — if the tab's git branch doesn't match the change folder name, send `/git-branch` to align it.

### Branch Fallback

When `fab resolve` fails during a **user-initiated** action (not monitoring ticks):

1. Scan branches: `git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/ refs/remotes/ | grep -iF "<query>"`
2. **Single match, read-only**: read `.status.yaml` via `git show <branch>:fab/changes/<folder>/.status.yaml`
3. **Single match, action**: create a worktree and proceed (`wt create --non-interactive --worktree-name <name> <branch>`)
4. **Multiple matches**: disambiguate. **No match**: report not found.

### Bounded Retries

| Situation | Max retries | Escalation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Stuck agent nudge | 1 | "{change} appears stuck at {stage}. Manual investigation recommended." |
| Rebase conflict | 0 | Immediately flag to user |
| Pane death | 0 | Report gone. Respawn only in autopilot (1 attempt) |
| Send to busy agent | 0 | Warn, require explicit confirmation |
| Cherry-pick conflict | 0 | Abort, log, escalate. Do not spawn. |

---

## 4. The Loop

The loop is the operator's heartbeat — a `/loop 3m "operator tick"` that runs as long as the monitored set is non-empty, an autopilot queue is active, or any watch is configured. When all three are empty, stop the loop. The loop starts when the first change is enrolled, an autopilot queue begins, or a watch is created. A user prompt can also restart it.

### `.fab-operator.yaml`

Persistent state at the repo root. Read on startup and every tick. Written after every state change.

```yaml
tick_count: 47
monitored:
  r3m7:
    pane: "%3"
    stage: apply
    agent: active
    stop_stage: null       # null = full pipeline, or a stage name to park at
    spawned_by: null       # watch name if spawned by a watch, null otherwise
    depends_on: []         # change IDs to cherry-pick before spawning
    branch: 260324-r3m7-add-retry-logic  # this change's branch name
    enrolled_at: "2026-03-23T17:30:00Z"
    last_transition: "2026-03-23T17:32:00Z"
autopilot:
  queue: [ab12, cd34, ef56]
  current: cd34
  completed: [ab12]
  state: running           # running | paused | null
branch_map:                # persists branch names after changes leave monitored set
  ab12: 260324-ab12-fix-auth
  cd34: 260324-cd34-add-oauth
watches:
  linear-bugs:
    enabled: true
    source: linear
    query: { project: "DEV", status: [Backlog, Todo], assignee: "@me" }
    stop_stage: intake
    known: [DEV-988, DEV-992]  # capped at 200, oldest pruned first
    completed: [DEV-985]       # items that reached stop_stage
    last_checked: "2026-03-23T17:29:00Z"
    last_error: null
    instructions: >
      Spawn agents for issues older than 1 hour with label 'bug'.
      Max 2 concurrent agents from this watch.
```

### Monitored Set

Each entry tracks: change ID, pane, last-known stage, last-known agent state, stop_stage, spawned_by (watch name or null), depends_on (change IDs to cherry-pick), branch (this change's branch name), enrolled-at, last-transition-at.

**Enrollment**: operator sends a command to a change, user requests monitoring, or operator triggers an automatic action (including autopilot and watch spawns). Read-only actions do not enroll. On enrollment, the change's branch name is also recorded in the top-level `branch_map`.

After writing the monitored entry to `.fab-operator.yaml`, the operator MUST prefix `»` (U+00BB) to the target tmux window's name via the `fab pane window-name ensure-prefix` primitive. The primitive enforces the idempotent literal-prefix check internally, so the rename applies to every enrollment path without the caller needing to guard:

```sh
fab pane window-name ensure-prefix <pane> »
```

Windows that already carry `»` (operator-spawned windows from §6, `/clear`-restored entries, re-enrolled changes) no-op through the primitive's guard. A non-zero exit — pane vanished between refresh and rename (exit 2) or any other tmux error (exit 3, including tmux not running / socket unreachable) — causes the operator to log one line and continue. Enrollment itself is already durable from the preceding `.fab-operator.yaml` write:

```
{change}: window rename skipped ({error}).
```

**Removal**: change reaches its stop stage (or a terminal stage if `stop_stage` is null), pane dies, user explicitly stops. The `branch_map` entry is **not** removed — it persists for downstream dependency resolution. On every removal path, the operator MUST swap the active-monitoring `»` prefix for the done-marker `›` (U+203A, SINGLE RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE QUOTATION MARK) via the `replace-prefix` primitive:

```sh
fab pane window-name replace-prefix <pane> » ›
```

The primitive's literal-prefix guard protects user-renamed windows (if the user renamed the window mid-monitoring so it no longer starts with `»`, the call no-ops). Exit 2 (pane missing — window is gone anyway) is treated as successful removal; other non-zero exits log `"{change}: window rename skipped ({error})."` and the operator continues. This keeps the tab bar an accurate at-a-glance map of what is currently tracked (`»` active) vs. operator-touched (`›` trail).

**Stop stage**: when `stop_stage` is set on a monitored entry, the operator treats that stage as the terminal stage for that change. On reaching it, the operator reports completion and removes the change — it does not push the agent further. Default is `null` (full pipeline: hydrate/ship/review-pr are terminal).

### Branch Map

The top-level `branch_map` persists change ID → branch name mappings. Entries are added when changes are enrolled in the monitored set. Entries persist after changes leave the monitored set (merged, archived, pane died) — this is necessary so downstream changes can still look up dependency branches for cherry-picking. Entries persist until the operator session ends or the user explicitly clears them.

### Tick Behavior

On each tick:

1. **Snapshot** — run `fab operator tick-start` (increments `tick_count`, writes `last_tick_at`, outputs `tick: N` and `now: HH:MM`). Parse stdout for the tick number and current time. Then run `fab pane map` and read `.fab-operator.yaml`. Compute status for all tracked items: stage advances, completions, review failures, pane deaths, and watch statuses from the last persisted check (`last_checked` / `last_error` / last counts). Output the status frame:

```
── Operator ── 17:32 ── tick #47 ── 7 tracked ──

  [change]  r3m7         ▶ ● apply → review
  [change]  k8ds         ▶ ◌ review · idle 18m ⚠
  [change]  ab12           ● hydrate ✓
  [change]  ef56           ✗ spec · idle 32m ⚠
  [watch]   gmail-deploys  ◌ 1 new · 2m ago
  [watch]   linear-bugs    ● 2 known · 1 completed · 3m ago
  [watch]   slack-alerts   ● 0 new · 1m ago

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

All tracked items render in a single flat list. Every row follows a consistent column layout:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Type | `[change]` or `[watch]` — bracketed type prefix |
| ID | Change ID (4-char) or watch name |
| Autopilot | `▶` if autopilot-driven, blank otherwise |
| Health | Status indicator — universal position across all types |
| Detail | Type-specific status text |

**Header**: `N tracked` is the total count of all entries (changes + watches). No per-type counts.

**Ordering**: Changes first (sorted by enrollment time), then watches (sorted alphabetically by name).

**Change health**: ● active, ◌ idle, ✗ stuck (>15m idle at non-terminal), ✓ complete.

**Watch health**: ● healthy (last query succeeded, no new items), ◌ has new unprocessed items, ✗ errored (`last_error` set), – paused (`enabled: false`).

**Autopilot marker**: `▶` marks changes driven by the autopilot queue. Non-autopilot changes (manually enrolled or watch-spawned) show blank. Queue state is readable from the list — which entries have `▶`, which are complete.

**Watch timestamps**: Relative format (`{N}m ago`) matching the idle duration format: `{N}s ago` (< 60s), `{N}m ago` (60s–59m), `{N}h ago` (>= 60m). Floor division.

2. **Auto-nudge** — for each idle agent, run question detection (§5). If a newly-spawned agent advances past intake, send `/git-branch` to align the branch.
3. **Watches** — for each watch, query the source, compare against `known`, spawn on new matches (§7).
4. **Autopilot dispatch** — if an autopilot queue is active, run the next autopilot action (§6). Autopilot-driven changes are visible in the frame via `▶`.
5. **Removals** — remove completed changes (reached stop stage or terminal stage) and dead panes from the monitored set.
6. **Persist** — write updated state to `.fab-operator.yaml`
7. **Loop lifecycle** — if monitored set is empty, no autopilot, and no watches, stop the loop.

Actions (nudges, removals, autopilot progress) print as plain lines below the frame as they happen:

```
k8ds: auto-answered 'Allow Bash: npm test?' → y
Removed ab12 (complete), ef56 (pane gone)
Autopilot: cd34 in progress · next: ef56
```

### Idle Message

Between ticks, the operator displays an idle message with the current time and next-tick time:

```
Waiting for next tick. Time: 08:26 · next tick: 08:29
```

Run `fab operator time --interval {interval}` (where `{interval}` is the current loop interval, e.g. `3m`) to get the `now:` and `next:` values to fill in the message. This lets the user gauge staleness at a glance without scrolling to the last tick frame.

---

## 5. Auto-Nudge

The operator auto-answers routine prompts from monitored agents. Each idle agent is checked every tick.

### Question Detection

1. **Capture**: `tmux capture-pane -t <pane> -p -S -20`
2. **Claude turn boundary guard**: `^\s*>\s*$` in last 2 lines → skip (normal human-turn boundary)
3. **Blank capture guard**: all blank → skip (treat as "cannot determine")
4. **Scan for indicators** (bottom-most match wins):
   - Lines ending with `?` (last non-empty line only, <120 chars, skip `#`/`//`/`*`/`>`/timestamp lines)
   - `[Y/n]`, `[y/N]`, `(y/n)`, `(yes/no)`
   - `Allow?`, `Approve?`, `Confirm?`, `Proceed?`
   - Claude Code permission/tool approval prompts
   - `Do you want to...`, `Should I...`, `Would you like...`
   - Lines ending with `:` (CLI input prompts)
   - Enumerated options (`[1-9]\)`)
   - `Press.*key`, `press.*enter`, `hit.*enter` (case-insensitive)
5. **No match** → stuck detection applies
6. **Match** → answer model

### Answer Model

Evaluate in order:

1. Binary yes/no or confirmation → `y`
2. `[Y/n]` or `[y/N]` → `y`
3. Claude Code permission prompt → `y`
4. Numbered menu:
   - Classify the prompt as **Routine** or **Strategic** using LLM judgment over the terminal capture. Signals: option text length, semantic distinctness of options, surrounding agent context, reversibility of the choice. No hardcoded keyword list.
     - **Routine** (tool/permission prompts, binary-framed menus, synonymous-option menus) → `1` (first/default).
     - **Strategic** (multi-option choices representing materially different directions — scope, PR split, pipeline shape, commit organization, spec/approach decisions) → escalate to user.
   - On classification uncertainty, treat as Strategic and escalate. False-negative strategic commits the queue to an unchosen direction; false-positive strategic costs at most a user nudge, which the 30-minute idle auto-default (below) will resolve.
5. Open-ended, answer determinable from visible context → send that answer
6. Cannot determine keystrokes → escalate to user

### Sending Auto-Answers

Before `tmux send-keys`: verify pane exists and agent is still idle (§3 steps 1-2), then re-capture the terminal. If output changed since detection, abort — agent is no longer waiting.

### Idle Auto-Default on Strategic Escalations

When rule 4 above escalates a prompt as **Strategic**, the operator starts a per-prompt idle timer measured in real time from the moment the escalation log line is written. If the prompt remains idle for 30 minutes, the operator auto-answers the prompt and logs using the distinct `auto-defaulted` format (§5 Logging).

**Threshold**: 30 minutes, hardcoded. No `.fab-operator.yaml` field, no per-change override, no environment variable exposes this value. The §4 `.fab-operator.yaml` schema is unchanged.

**Idle clock reset**: the idle timer resets on any terminal-state change in the pane — new content appended by the agent, user keystrokes that alter the prompt display, or the prompt's own redraw. The timer is a watchdog on pane-idle-ness, not on escalation-open-ness. Tick cadence already provides sub-minute resolution via §4 Tick Behavior — no new polling infrastructure is required.

**Answer selection** (in priority order):

1. If the prompt text visibly states a default (e.g., `(default: 2)`, `Press enter for 2`, `[2]`), send that stated default.
2. Otherwise, send `1`.

This matches rule 4's existing "first/default" semantics for routine menus.

**Scope (hard exclusion)**: the idle auto-default applies ONLY to escalations produced by rule 4's Strategic classification path. Escalations produced by rule 6 ("cannot determine keystrokes") MUST NOT trigger the idle auto-default — the operator does not know what the correct keystrokes are, so sending `1` or the stated default would emit nonsense into the pane. Rule-6 escalations remain open pending user action regardless of idle duration.

### Logging

- Auto-answer: `"{change}: auto-answered '{summary}' → {answer}"`
- Escalation: `"{change}: can't determine answer for '{summary}'. Please respond."`
- Auto-default (after 30m idle on strategic escalation): `"{change}: auto-defaulted after 30m idle: '{summary}' → {answer}"`

---

## 6. Coordination Patterns

The operator understands the full fab pipeline and command vocabulary. It infers the right action from current state rather than following named playbooks.

### Pipeline Reference

```
intake → spec → tasks → apply → review → hydrate → ship
```

**Setup commands**: `/fab-new` (create + activate change), `/fab-draft` (create without activating), `/fab-switch` (activate existing change), `/git-branch` (align branch)

**Pipeline commands**: `/fab-proceed` (auto-detect state, run `/fab-new` → `/git-branch` as needed, then `/fab-fff`), `/fab-continue` (one stage), `/fab-fff` (full pipeline), `/fab-ff` (fast-forward to hydrate), `/git-pr` (commit, push, create PR)

**Maintenance**: rebase onto `origin/main`, merge PR (`gh pr merge`), `/fab-archive`

### Spawning an Agent

Read `agent.spawn_command` from `config.yaml` (loaded at startup). Default: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. Use this as the command prefix when opening agent tabs.

The spawn sequence is:

1. **Create worktree** — `wt create --non-interactive --worktree-name <wt> [<branch>]`
2. **Resolve dependencies** — if the change has a non-empty `depends_on` list, cherry-pick dependency content into the worktree (see below)
3. **Open agent tab** — `tmux new-window -n "»<wt>" -c <worktree-path> "<spawn_cmd> '<command>'"` (where `<wt>` is the worktree name from step 1)
4. **Enroll in monitored set** — unconditionally and silently record pane, stage, branch, depends_on in `.fab-operator.yaml`; add branch to `branch_map`. MUST NOT prompt the user about whether to monitor. (Enrollment calls `fab pane window-name ensure-prefix <pane> »` per §4; the `»<wt>` name produced in step 3 already satisfies the primitive's idempotent prefix check, so no duplicate rename occurs.)

> **Auto-enroll is mandatory.** Every spawned agent MUST be enrolled in the monitored set immediately as part of the spawn sequence. The operator MUST NOT ask the user whether to monitor a spawned agent — this decision is already made by the act of spawning. If the operator spawned it, it is monitored. No exceptions.

### Dependency Resolution

Before opening the agent tab, given this change's `depends_on` list:

1. **Resolve all dependency branches** — For each change ID in `depends_on`, look up its branch:
   - First from the monitored entry's `branch` field (if the dep is still active).
   - Otherwise from `branch_map` (if the dep has left the monitored set).

   Build a mapping `dep_change_id -> dep_branch` for the entire `depends_on` set. If any dependency branch is not found in either location: log `"{change}: dependency {dep} branch not found. Escalating."`, escalate to the user, and do **not** spawn the agent.

2. **Prune redundant deps across the full set** — Using the resolved `dep_change_id -> dep_branch` mapping, remove dependencies whose branches are ancestors of other dependency branches in the same set:
   - If dep A's branch is an ancestor of dep B's branch (both listed in `depends_on`), drop A from the effective dependency set.
   - Check via: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <A-branch> <B-branch>`.

   This pruning is done *across the full set* of dependency branches before any cherry-picks, to prevent duplicate cherry-picks in chains where B's branch already carries A's content transitively.

3. **For each remaining (pruned) dependency** in the effective set, in the target worktree:

   a. **Check if already present** — run:
      ```bash
      git merge-base --is-ancestor <dep-branch> HEAD
      ```
      If the dep branch is already an ancestor of `HEAD`, skip this dependency's cherry-pick.

   b. **Cherry-pick** — if not already present, in the worktree directory:
      ```bash
      git cherry-pick --no-commit origin/main..<dep-branch> && \
      git commit -m "operator: cherry-pick <dep-change> dependency"
      ```
      This cherry-picks all commits unique to the dependency branch since it diverged from `origin/main`, stages them without individual commits, and squashes into a single operator commit.

   c. **On conflict** — abort immediately, do not spawn:
      ```bash
      git cherry-pick --abort
      ```
      Log: `"{change}: cherry-pick conflict with dependency {dep-change}. Escalating."`
      Escalate to user. Do not proceed without the dependency content. Bounded retry: 0 (§3).

**Why `origin/main` as base**: Each dependency branch carries its full transitive dependency content. When the operator spawned dep B, it cherry-picked dep A into B's worktree first. B's branch therefore contains A's commits. So `origin/main..<B-branch>` gives the complete transitive closure — no need to chase transitive deps manually. This is why only direct/leaf dependencies need cherry-picking.

### Dependency Declaration

Dependencies are declared through three conversational paths, all of which coexist:

1. **Explicit**: "cd34 depends on ab12" — operator sets `depends_on: [ab12]` on the monitored entry
2. **Autopilot queue (implicit)**: user-provided ordering implies `--base` chaining by default — every change after the first automatically gets `depends_on: [<prev-change-id>]`
3. **`--base` flag (explicit)**: autopilot `--base <prev-change>` explicitly sets `depends_on: [<prev-change-id>]` for the subsequent change (redundant with path 2 for user-provided ordering, but available for ad-hoc use)

### Working a Change

> **Pipeline-first routing (§1):** All three work paths below MUST go through the fab pipeline. For *new* work, this means `/fab-new` followed by a pipeline command; for already-intaked changes, start from the appropriate pipeline command stage instead of repeating `/fab-new`. The operator MUST NOT send raw implementation instructions directly to agent panes. See the "Pipeline-first routing" principle in §1.

The operator accepts work in three forms:

**From existing change** (already has intake or further):
1. Create worktree (`wt create --non-interactive --worktree-name <wt>`)
2. Resolve dependencies (cherry-pick `depends_on` entries — see above)
3. Spawn agent: `tmux new-window -n "»<wt>" -c <worktree-path> "<spawn_cmd> '/fab-switch <change> && /fab-proceed'"`
4. Enroll in monitored set
5. On completion: PR ready, optionally archive

`/fab-switch` activates the target change so `/fab-proceed` knows which one to run. `/fab-proceed` then handles `/git-branch` → `/fab-fff` automatically.

**From raw text** (e.g., "fix login after password reset"):
1. Create worktree (`wt create --non-interactive`)
2. Resolve dependencies (cherry-pick `depends_on` entries — see above)
3. Spawn agent: `tmux new-window -n "»<wt>" -c <worktree-path> "<spawn_cmd> '/fab-new <shell_escaped_description>'"` — where `<shell_escaped_description>` is the raw description text safely shell-escaped for inclusion in a single-quoted shell argument (do not insert unescaped raw text directly)
4. Enroll in monitored set
5. On completion: PR ready, optionally archive

**From backlog ID or Linear issue** (structured):
1. Look up the idea (`idea show <id>`) or resolve the Linear issue
2. Create worktree (`wt create --non-interactive --worktree-name <wt>`)
3. Resolve dependencies (cherry-pick `depends_on` entries — see above)
4. Spawn agent: `tmux new-window -n "»<wt>" -c <worktree-path> "<spawn_cmd> '/fab-new <id>'"`
5. Enroll in monitored set
6. On completion: PR ready, optionally archive

Both raw text and backlog paths use `/fab-new` to generate a proper intake with traceability. `/fab-new` captures the raw input in the intake's Origin section — the user just says "fix [description]" and the operator does the rest.

### Autopilot

User provides a queue of changes. Confirmation prompt reflects the active mode:
- **Default (stack-then-review):** "Confirm upfront (creates PRs — merge after review)."
- **`--merge-on-complete`:** "Confirm upfront (merges PRs on completion)."

Queue ordering:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| User-provided | Run in the exact order given. Implicit `--base` chaining by default: every change after the first gets `depends_on: [<prev-change-id>]`. No explicit `--base` flag required. |
| Confidence-based | Sort by confidence score descending. Highest-confidence first (independent changes) |
| Hybrid | User provides constraints (partial order); operator sorts unconstrained by confidence |

**`--merge-on-complete`** — opt-in flag that reverts to the previous merge-as-you-go behavior: merge each PR on completion, rebase next change onto `origin/main`. Implicit `--base` chaining is disabled under this flag — each change rebases onto `origin/main` independently instead of stacking on the previous change's branch. Natural language equivalents: "merge as you go", "merge on complete", "merge each when done". Without this flag, the default is stack-then-review: PRs are created but not merged until the user explicitly requests merging, and implicit `--base` chaining is active (every change after the first gets `depends_on: [<prev-change-id>]`).

The operator works each change through the pipeline, applying pre-send validation (§3) before dispatching:

1. **Spawn** — create worktree (`--reuse` for respawns)
2. **Resolve dependencies** — cherry-pick `depends_on` entries into the worktree, then open agent tab and enroll
3. **Gate** — check confidence score. If below threshold, flag and wait
4. **Dispatch** — send `/fab-fff` (or appropriate command based on current stage)
5. **Monitor** — normal tick detection handles progress
6. **Record** — on completion, record branch in `branch_map`, collect PR URL
7. **Dispatch next** — spawn next change (with implicit `depends_on: [<prev-change-id>]`), cherry-pick deps, dispatch
8. **Report** — `"ab12: PR ready. 1 of 3 complete. Starting cd34."`
9. **(After all complete) Summary** — list all PR links with dependency annotations and merge order suggestion (see Queue Completion Summary below)

When `--merge-on-complete` is active, steps 6–9 revert to the previous merge-as-you-go behavior: merge PR on completion, rebase next change onto `origin/main`, report merge.

Autopilot-driven changes display `▶` in the status frame (§4). Queue progress is visible from the list — entries with `▶` that show ✓ are complete, the one showing ●/◌ is current.

#### Queue Completion Summary

When all changes in a stack-then-review autopilot queue complete, the operator displays a completion summary:

```
Queue complete. 3 PRs ready for review:
1. ab12: <PR-URL-1> (base)
2. cd34: <PR-URL-2> (depends on ab12)
3. ef56: <PR-URL-3> (depends on cd34)
Merge in order (1→2→3) when ready, or ask me to merge all.
```

For a single-item queue: `"ab12: PR ready. Queue complete."`

#### Ordered Merge

When the user says "merge all" or "merge the queue" after a stack-then-review queue completes, the operator merges PRs in dependency order (base-first), waiting for CI to pass on each before proceeding to the next:

1. Merge PR 1 (base) — wait for CI pass
2. Merge PR 2 — wait for CI pass
3. Merge PR 3 — wait for CI pass

Report each merge: `"ab12: merged (1/3)"`, `"cd34: merged (2/3)"`, `"ef56: merged (3/3)"`.

**CI failure during ordered merge**: If CI fails on any PR, the operator stops merging and reports: `"{change}: CI failed. Merge halted at {completed}/{total}. Fix and retry."` It does not attempt to merge subsequent PRs.

Autopilot state (queue, current, completed) persists in `.fab-operator.yaml`.

**Failures**: review exhausted → skip. Rebase conflict → skip (`--merge-on-complete` only; does not apply in default stack-then-review mode since there are no rebase steps). Cherry-pick conflict → escalate (do not skip). Pane dies → 1 respawn (`--reuse`), then skip. Stage timeout (>30m) → flag. Total timeout (>2h) → flag.

**Interrupts**: "stop after current", "skip <change>", "pause", "resume" — acknowledged immediately.

## 7. Watches

Watches are standing instructions to monitor an external source and take action when new items appear. Users create watches conversationally: "watch Linear project DEV for new issues, spawn agents, stop at intake."

### Schema

Each watch in `.fab-operator.yaml` has:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` or `false` — paused watches retain config but skip tick evaluation |
| `source` | `linear` or `slack` — determines which MCP tool to query |
| `query` | Source-specific API filter (project, status, assignee, channel) — passed to MCP |
| `stop_stage` | How far to go: `intake`, `spec`, `hydrate`, or `null` (full pipeline) |
| `known` | Already-handled item IDs — managed automatically, capped at 200 (oldest pruned first) |
| `completed` | Items that reached `stop_stage` — lets users query "what did this watch produce?" |
| `last_checked` | ISO timestamp of last successful query |
| `last_error` | Last error message, or `null`. Shown in status frame when set |
| `instructions` | Free-form natural language — trigger conditions, concurrency limits, label filters, anything else |

Structured fields handle machine-readable concerns; `instructions` handles everything the operator evaluates as an LLM. Concurrency limits in `instructions` are enforced by counting monitored entries where `spawned_by` matches the watch name.

### Tick Behavior

On each tick (step 3), for each enabled watch:

1. **Query source** — Linear via MCP (`mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues`), Slack via MCP (`mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_channel`), using `query` as the API filter. On failure: set `last_error`, skip this watch for this tick. After 3 consecutive failures: disable the watch, alert user.
2. **Deduplicate** — skip items in `known` list. Update `last_checked`.
3. **Evaluate instructions** — apply trigger conditions, label filters, concurrency limits (count monitored entries with `spawned_by: <watch-name>`), and any other criteria from `instructions`
4. **Act** — for each item that passes:
   - Spawn worktree, open agent tab, send appropriate command (e.g., `/fab-new DEV-123`)
   - Enroll in monitored set with `stop_stage` and `spawned_by` from the watch
   - Add item ID to `known` (only after successful spawn)
   - Prune `known` if over 200 entries (drop oldest)
5. **Report** — `"Watch linear-bugs: DEV-1024 — Fix auth redirect (72m old). Spawning."`

When a watch-spawned agent reaches its `stop_stage`, move the item ID from `known` to `completed` and report: `"Watch linear-bugs: DEV-1024 completed intake."`

### Conversational Management

- "Watch Linear project DEV for bugs older than 1 hour, spawn agents, stop at intake" → creates watch
- "Pause the Linear watch" / "Resume the Linear watch" → toggles `enabled`
- "Stop watching Linear" → removes watch
- "What are you watching?" → lists active watches with instructions and completed items
- "What did linear-bugs produce?" → lists `completed` items
- "Test watch linear-bugs" → dry-run: query, deduplicate, evaluate instructions, report what *would* happen without spawning or updating state
- "Change the Linear watch to go through full pipeline" → updates `stop_stage` to null
- "Also limit to 2 concurrent agents" → appends to `instructions`

## 8. Configuration

| Setting | Default | Override via natural language |
|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| Loop interval | 3m | "check every {N}m" |
| Stuck threshold | 15m | "flag agents stuck for more than {N}m" |

Session-scoped — resets on `/clear` or session restart.

## 9. Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Requires active change? | No |
| Runs preflight? | No |
| Read-only? | No — sends commands, auto-answers, writes `.fab-operator.yaml` |
| Idempotent? | Yes — state re-derived every tick |
| Advances stage? | No |
| Outputs `Next:` line? | No — ends with ready signal |
| Loads change artifacts? | No — coordination context only |
| Requires tmux? | Yes — hard stop without it |
| Uses `/loop`? | Yes — 3m heartbeat |
| Uses `.fab-operator.yaml`? | Yes — monitored set + autopilot queue + branch map persistence |
