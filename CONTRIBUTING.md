# Contributing to Fab Kit

## Documentation Structure

Fab Kit's documentation is split into two categories:

- **[docs/specs/](docs/specs/index.md)** — Pre-implementation design specs. Human-curated, captures the "why" behind features. Organize however makes sense.
- **[docs/memory/](docs/memory/index.md)** — Post-implementation memory files. AI-maintained via hydration, authoritative source of truth for system behavior.

### Reading Paths

#### Contributor — "I want to modify or extend Fab Kit"

1. **[docs/specs/overview.md](docs/specs/overview.md)** — workflow design and principles (prerequisite for everything)
2. **[docs/specs/glossary.md](docs/specs/glossary.md)** — terminology you'll see everywhere
3. **[fab/project/constitution.md](fab/project/constitution.md)** — immutable project principles (MUST/SHOULD rules)
4. **[docs/specs/architecture.md](docs/specs/architecture.md)** — directory structure, config, naming, agent integration
5. **[docs/specs/skills.md](docs/specs/skills.md)** — detailed behavior for each `/fab-*` skill
6. **[docs/memory/fab-workflow/kit-architecture.md](docs/memory/fab-workflow/kit-architecture.md)** — `.kit/` internals, scripts, distribution
7. **[docs/specs/templates.md](docs/specs/templates.md)** — artifact template system
8. **[src/lib/stageman/README.md](src/lib/stageman/README.md)** — Stage Manager development guide and testing

#### Spec Reader — "I want to understand the design rationale"

1. **[docs/specs/glossary.md](docs/specs/glossary.md)** — read this first to understand the vocabulary
2. **[docs/specs/overview.md](docs/specs/overview.md)** — high-level design, principles, stage definitions
3. **[docs/specs/architecture.md](docs/specs/architecture.md)** — structural decisions and conventions
4. **[docs/specs/skills.md](docs/specs/skills.md)** — skill-by-skill behavioral specification
5. **[docs/specs/templates.md](docs/specs/templates.md)** — template design and field semantics
6. **[docs/specs/user-flow.md](docs/specs/user-flow.md)** — visual command flow diagrams

## Stage Manager

The kit includes **Stage Manager** (`stageman.sh`), a bash utility for querying workflow stages and states:

```bash
# Query utility
fab/.kit/scripts/lib/stageman.sh --help     # Show all available functions
fab/.kit/scripts/lib/stageman.sh --version  # Show version
fab/.kit/scripts/lib/stageman.sh --test     # Run self-tests

# Use in scripts
source fab/.kit/scripts/lib/stageman.sh
get_all_stages                          # List stages
get_stage_number "spec"                 # Get position (2)
validate_status_file .status.yaml       # Validate change status
```

**Development & Testing:**

```bash
# Run basic tests
src/lib/stageman/test-simple.sh

# View API documentation and development guide
cat src/lib/stageman/README.md
```

For complete documentation, see:
- [docs/memory/fab-workflow/schemas.md](docs/memory/fab-workflow/schemas.md) - Schema overview
- [src/lib/stageman/README.md](src/lib/stageman/README.md) - API reference and development guide

## Creating a Release

To publish a new release:

```bash
fab-release.sh [patch|minor|major]
```

- `patch` (default): 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
- `minor`: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
- `major`: 0.1.0 → 1.0.0

The script will:
1. Bump the version in `fab/.kit/VERSION`
2. Package `fab/.kit/` into `kit.tar.gz`
3. Commit the VERSION bump
4. Create a GitHub Release with `kit.tar.gz` as an asset

**Requires**: clean working tree, [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/), and a configured `origin` remote.
